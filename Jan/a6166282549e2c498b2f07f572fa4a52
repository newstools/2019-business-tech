The US embassy has announced that applications for the 2020-2021 Fulbright Foreign Student Program are now open. This world-renowned program offers scholarships to South Africans interested in pursuing a Master’s or Doctoral degree at any accredited tertiary institution in the United States. The scholarships cover up to the full cost of tuition and living expenses in the US. The Fulbright Program is the US government’s flagship international educational exchange. It was established in 1946 to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. It currently operates in South Africa and more than 150 countries worldwide. In 2018, 29 South African students and scholars received fully-funded Fulbright scholarships to complete postgraduate studies at American academic institutions and to conduct research in the United States. These South Africans are currently pursuing studies in fields ranging from molecular biology, viticulture, economics, and audiology, to mechanical engineering, occupational therapy and philosophy at institutions including Ohio State University, University of Missouri, Rochester Institute of Technology, University of California, and the University of Pennsylvania. Applications close on 19 April 2019, but applicants are encouraged to start the application process as soon as possible, the embassy said.
