The bakkie market continues to expand in South Africa, with both the Ford Ranger and Toyota Hilux continuing to top the best sellers list. And 2019 will be no different with Ford expected to launch its Ranger Raptor model in the first quarter. The Raptor will be wider with a higher clearance (46mm higher than regular Rangers) to withstand high-impact off-roading. The Ranger Raptor has a reinforced chassis frame, using high-strength, low-alloy steels. Under the bonnet is a 2.0-litre bi-turbo diesel engine making 157kW of power and 500Nm of torque. The Raptor will join a large selection of models and shapes already in the local market.
