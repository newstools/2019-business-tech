Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: Eskom is begging South Africans to give it more money. Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe has made a desperate plea for a 15% tariff hike every year for the next three years to help raise funds to get the company out of a debt trap. He acknowledged the problem was of Eskom’s own making, but said all South Africans were needed to avert disaster. [Business Day] Despite Vodacom drawing a line under the matter, its Please Call Me saga appears to be far from over. Nkosana Makate said he and his legal team are looking at options to challenge the payout from Vodacom for the idea. Makate wanted 15c for every R1 earned by Vodacom for Please Call Mes. [EWN] The state capture commission will resume on Tuesday – but with no clear indication on who will be testifying.
