MyBroadband Insights has released its Q4 2018 Mobile Network Quality Report, which ranks South Africa’s mobile networks. The report is based on 12,092 unique results from MyBroadband’s android speed test app which were recorded between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2018. The download speed (60%), upload speed (20%), and latency (20%) are used to calculate a network quality score. The network score is a value which shows the relative performance of networks, with a maximum score of 10. To ensure accurate results, unnatural results were ﬁltered out, and cell down-sampling was used, MyBroadband Insights said. MTN comes out on top  The research shows that South Africa had an average mobile download speed of 22.18 Mbps during the period. MTN had the highest average download speed at 26.95 Mbps, followed by Vodacom on 26.78 Mbps, Rain on 21.67 Mbps, Telkom on 19.83 Mbps, and Cell C on 15.56 Mbps. MyBroadband Insights director, Marius Hollenbach said the results were in line with expectations and closely tracked the network investments by mobile operators. Hollenbach said that MTN’s network investment over the past few years was significantly higher than Vodacom’s, a fact that was now being reflected in these results. MTN has made significant infrastructure investments over the last four years, with the company spending R43.6 billion to expand its 3G and LTE network footprint across South Africa. MTN currently has more than 11,000 LTE sites which brought its 4G population coverage in the country up to 90%. Read: Vodacom pays ex-worker for `Please Call Me’ idea
