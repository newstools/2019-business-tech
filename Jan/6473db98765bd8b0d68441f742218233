According to CareerJunction, the most in-demand job skills are, however, featured here. As was the trend for almost all of 2018, Software developers, financial and project accountants and financial managers are the most sought-after skills in the country. Software developers remain in high demand in the South African job market, particularly professionals with C# and Java skills. Although there is still high demand for financial / project accountants, hiring activity has slowed down over the last three months, resulting in a 34% decrease in jobs since June, CareerJunction said. And despite a drop in vacancies toward the end of 2018, middle and department managers are also still in high demand. Financial management remained at the forefront of skills demand over the last few months, the group said. Read: 25 of the most in-demand skills in 2019 – according to LinkedIn
