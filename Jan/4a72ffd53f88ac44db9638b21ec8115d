Specialist recruitment firm, Michael Page, has published its latest salary survey – showing what skilled professionals in 164 different jobs in South Africa can expect to earn in 2019. The salary information is based on Michael Page’s extensive recruitment database, which covers more than 1,000 job roles, and over 100,000 candidates. According to the recruiter, the South African labour market has once again been unpredictable. “Despite a short recovery observed in South Africa in the first half of 2018 and the emergence from a recession with a +2.2% GDP growth in the third quarter, the official unemployment rate is back at its 2017 level,” it said. “This is due to weak investment & consumer confidence, along with continued limited household spending & private investment. “With the economic stimulus package announced in September 2018 and a heightened commitment to attract foreign investment, we are expecting a positive economic impact on the GDP growth and the unemployment rate for 2019.” While the majority of sectors remain under pressure, significant drivers for more positive development will come from the Banking & Financial Services, IT and Transportation sectors, the recruiter said. “As a result of limited household spending and private investment over the last 3 years, local and international organisations continue to be cautious when expanding into the African markets. “Salaries and bonuses have tended to follow a consistent pattern over the past five years, with steady increases to reflect inflationary pressures.” Below are the average salaries finance and accounting professionals can expect to earn in 2019.
