Travelstart has launched ‘Travelstart for Business’, a business travel booking and reporting tool offered to companies and individuals globally. Travelstart for Business will offer a secure dashboard where companies can book travel, add travellers and monitor business travel through reporting tools. Travellers can toggle between their personal and business travel accounts within the Travelstart site, separating personal and leisure bookings from those for work. In addition, business travellers can benefit from negotiated fares, corporate deals, no setup fees and round-the-clock customer support. Travelstart’s head of product, Pia Spratley, said that the product was specifically designed for businesses and is open to anyone. “Any company and individual can sign up for free by creating an account on the Travelstart website,” she said.
