South Africans had a tumultuous 2018 – dealing with one of the world’s most volatile currencies, high petrol prices, and an increasing cost of living. While a weaker rand is not good news for South African tourists looking to travel abroad, it may ultimately help boost tourism in the country as international travellers find that there dollars, euros and pounds stretch further. However, despite a poor 2018 for the rand, there are still a number of countries where it is still relatively inexpensive for South Africans to travel in 2019. Below BusinessTech looked at nine countries where is R1 is worth more than the local currency as at 3 January 2019. Because direct currency conversion does not always give a good indication of the general cost of living, we also compared the cost of food, drinks and travel compared to what you would pay locally. Note: These comparisons have a bigger focus on travel and touring, rather than general living costs. Mexico (Mexico City)  R1 will buy you: 1.35 Mexican Pesos
