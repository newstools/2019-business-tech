Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Francois Beukman, has urged matriculants who are interested in a career in law enforcement to apply at their nearest police station. In a statement, Beukman said that interested parties should apply before the Friday (18 January) deadline this week. Matriculants who wants to make a contribution to their community and serve to achieve a safer South Africa are encouraged to apply to become trainees within the South African Police Service (SAPS), he said. Beukman added that young people between the ages of 18 and 30 who are in possession of a grade 12 certificate and have the necessary fitness levels should make use of Saps’ first 2019 recruitment opportunity. “We need dedicated, motivated and energetic young people, who want to make a difference to the crime situation in the country, and who will lead by example,” Beukman said. Beukman said that the portfolio committee fully supports the strict vetting criteria and psychometric testing used by SAPS to establish if applicants are suitable for the job. Aspiring police members must have no links to criminality and fit the profile of a career law-enforcement officer. In May 2018, the SAPS embarked on a recruitment drive across the country for its Basic Police Learning Development Programme (BLDP) intake, which could only accommodate 3,500 people. However, the SAPS said it received some 517,000 applications from youth between the ages of 18 and 30 years at over 1,146 police stations nationwide.
