The Times Higher Education (THE) rankings for the top universities in emerging markets has been publishes, with 9 South African institutions listed among the ranks – including a new entry. The THE Emerging Economies University Rankings for 2019 use the same 13 performance indicators as the THE World University Rankings to judge institutions on their teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook.

China claims four of the top five positions – and seven of the top 10. Tsinghua University surpasses Peking University as this year’s top institution overall. India is still the second most-represented country with 49 institutions included, up from 42. The nation has also increased its presence in the top 200, from 17 to 25 institutions, to surpass Taiwan as the second most-represented in the group. Russia’s performance is mixed – while several universities have declined, there are also some significant risers and prominent newcomers. The country has 35 institutions included, up from 27 last year, overtaking Taiwan as the fourth most-represented in the overall table. Brazil is the most-represented Latin American nation – and third most-represented in the table – with 36 institutions, up from 32. But 17 of these have declined, including its two leading universities. South Africa, the final member of the BRICS group, has nine institutions, up from eight last year, and retains seven in the top 200. Elsewhere, emerging nations across Europe have generally declined, while several countries in the Middle East and North Africa and Southeast Asian regions have progressed, THE said.
