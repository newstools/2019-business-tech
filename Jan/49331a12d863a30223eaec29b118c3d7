MTN has warned its customers to be wary of missed calls from international phone numbers. In an SMS sent on Friday (18 January), the telecoms company urged customers to “exercise caution when calling back missed calls (or replying to requests to call from unknown international numbers)”. MyBroadband has previously reported on the ‘Wangiri‘ scam which has targeted South African customers on every major mobile network. Wangiri is a form of phone fraud which originated in Japan. The name translates to “one and cut”, and comes from fraudsters calling your phone, letting it ring once, and then disconnecting their call. If you return the missed call, you are tricked into calling a premium-rated number that charges exorbitant rates. In some instances, this can result in thousands of rands being charged while just being on the phone for several seconds. The reports state that the calls are from across Africa and Europe, including Guinea, France, and Belgium.  Read: Communications minister tells Vodacom to ‘pay up’ in Please Call Me saga
