The Competition Tribunal has fined Computicket for abuse of dominance. In a judgement released on Monday (21 January), the Tribunal said that the ticketing company abuse occurred between 2005 – 2010 and instituted an administrative penalty of R20 million. In a statement, the Tribunal said that the decision followed protracted litigation in the matter and an earlier investigation by the Competiton Commission into the company’s use of long-term exclusive agreements to exclude entrants from the outsourced ticket distribution market. Between 2008 and 2009 the Competition Commission received five complaints from Strictly Tickets, Artslink, Going Places, TicketSpace and Ezimidlalo Technologies (the complainants) against Computicket. The complainants alleged that Computicket engaged in anti-competitive practices by concluding exclusive agreements with inventory providers for the provision of outsourced ticket distribution services for the entertainment industry which covers events such as sports, cinemas, theatres, festivals and live events. The Commission consolidated the complaints into a single case as all the complaints raised similar allegations and were against the same respondent.
