Jobs portal CareerJunction has published its latest index, showing which job skills are in the highest demand at the start of 2019. Demand for advertising skills slowed down noticeably towards the end of 2018 – however, employment prospects remained positive for job seekers as job search activity cooled considerably. While demand dropped by 17% in December, job search activity dropped by 21%, CareerJunction said. “While job ad volumes in the construction, manufacturing and engineering sectors improved slightly during the second half of 2018, compared to the first half of 2018, the opposite was seen in the admin, office & support, sales, marketing and medical sectors where job volumes were down by over 40% year-on-year,” it said. The trending jobs over the last month include purchasing and procurement, internal auditing, and financial / project accounting, the recruitment specialist said.

Software developers remain in high demand in the South African job market, particularly professionals with C# and Java skills. Although there is still high demand for financial / project accountants, hiring activity has slowed down over the last three months, resulting in a 34% decrease in jobs since June, CareerJunction said. And despite a drop in vacancies toward the end of 2018, middle and department managers are also still in high demand. Financial management remained at the forefront of skills demand over the last few months, the group said.

The IT, business & management and finance sectors are the most sought after sectors, followed by the sales, admin, office & support and architecture & engineering sectors. When looking at active job seekers across various sectors, areas of high supply correlate closely to areas of high demand, however supply outstrips demand in some areas, leading to a competitive environment for job seekers.
