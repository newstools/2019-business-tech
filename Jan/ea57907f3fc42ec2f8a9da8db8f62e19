The Department of Education has announced the overall matric result for 2018, revealing a pass mark of 78.2% – marking a 3.1 percentage point increase from 2017. Education minister Angie Motshekga delivered the results for the National Senior Certificate, on Thursday evening (3 January 2019) noting that approximately 512,700 full-time candidates, and 117,660 part-time candidates actually wrote all seven subjects of the 2018 NSC examinations. According to the Department of Education’s School Performance report for 2018, there were 101 high schools in South Africa that have emerged as the most consistently best-performing schools over the last five years. Each of these schools have managed to attain a 100% matric pass rate in writing the National Senior Certificate since 2014. While all 101 schools on the list can boast the achievement, it is particularly noteworthy in the high schools where large numbers of matrics wrote and passed the exams. Among the schools listed by the department, Gereformeerde Skool Dirk Postma in Gauteng posted the best result, with 357 matriculants passing the 2018 exams. This was followed by another Gauteng school, Hoërskool Linden, which saw its 244 matrics that made up the class of 2018 going through. Combined, the top 101 best performing schools accounted for 7,625 learners that passed their exams. While more Gauteng schools achieved the five-year 100% pass rate (28 schools), Western Cape schools (25) accounted for the most learners – 2,122 vs Gauteng’s 2,112.
