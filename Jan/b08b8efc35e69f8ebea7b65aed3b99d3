In a statement released on Wednesday (30 January), the Department of Labour said that the appointments include independent experts, representatives of organised business, organised community and organised labour respectively to serve on the NMW Commission, it said. Some of the function of the commission will include the following: Reviewing the national minimum wage and recommending its adjustment;

Investigating income differentials and advising the minister on measures to reduce income differentials;
Setting medium-term targets for the national minimum wage within three years of the commencement of this Act;
Advising the minister on sectoral determinations; and
Advising the minister on any matter concerning basic conditions of employment. Review It was announced in late 2017 that a 10-member national minimum wage commission would be set up to assess and review the NMW levels each year, with any adjustments being announced in the March before the increase takes effect. The purpose of the review is to take a number of factors into consideration such as inflation, the cost of living, wage levels, wage differentials, productivity, the ability of business to carry on successfully as well as the impact on SMMEâ€™s and employment, and advise the labour minister accordingly. The new regulations governing minimum wage also empowers the commission to promote medium-term targets to reduce wage differentials. This will see all minimum wages, including the current exemptions, reaching one level over time. Read: National minimum wage inspections will start next month
