The Free State has implemented tough new rules for motorists who are caught speeding in the province. According to Rapport, the Director of Public Prosecutions has banned all diversion programmes for speeding offences where a motorist exceeded the limit by 30km/h in urban areas and 40km/h on freeways in the province. Diversion programmes aim to bring offenders to an understanding that their traffic offence is not only a criminal offence, but may lead to the death or serious injury of themselves, passengers and other people. The programme typically consists of several interventions – such as a written traffic offences assignment – with successful completion typically leading to the criminal case being withdrawn. The effective banning of these programmes now means that speeding motorists now face up to three years of prison and/or the automatic suspensions of licences. Speaking to the Rapport, Free State traffic spokesperson, Hillary Mophethe, said that officers in her department had been briefed on the change. She added that her department was well-managed and was prepared for the expected influx of cases and the number of time officers will need to testify in court.
