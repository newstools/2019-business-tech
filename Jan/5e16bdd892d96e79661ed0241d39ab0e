As part of a recent parliamentary Q&A session, the Department of Higher Education has released enrolment statistics based on numbers at South Africa’s higher education institutes. The data shows that there has been a steady uptick in the number of enrolled students at South Africa’s universities, with the total number of enrolled students rising from just below 800,000 in 2008 to over a million in 2018. Community Education and Training (CET) colleges and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges have also seen strong enrolment growth since their establishment in 2015 and 2010 respectively. According to an August 2017 report by the IRR, South Africa’s absorption rate – the proportion of people of working age who are employed – depends largely on a person’s level of education. For example, the absorption rate for people with a tertiary education is 75.6%, while people with a matric as their highest level of education, have an absorption rate of 50.3%. You can find the complete university enrolment statistics detailed below. * The enrolment data for CET colleges is provided from the 2015 academic year onwards as CET colleges were only established in 2015. ** Enrolment data prior to 2010 resides with the Department of Education. *** Provisional data What South Africans are studying According to the latest enrollment data provided by Stats SA (2017), 2.1 million adults aged 20 years and older have attained a tertiary qualification at a South African university. The largest number of these – 503,096 graduates – studied Education. This is followed by Business and Economics (439,719 graduates), Health (221,121) and Engineering (219,007). Interestingly Stats SA found that 166,224 (close to 8%) of South Africa’s university graduates are aged 20–24 – whereas the majority (close to 52%) are between 25 and 44 years old. This is due to either the slow progress of students in the higher education system or the late entry of students in the higher education system, the report noted.
