Ster-Kinekor has hiked its ticket prices recently, with some theatres charging as much as 20% more than in early 2018, reports MyBroadband. Nu Metro, its major competitor, by comparison, has left its prices unchanged, although it previously implemented a lofty hike for its “Scene VIP” cinemas as well as cheaper theatres like Mountain Mill in Worcester. A 3D movie at one of Ster-Kinekor’s top-tier cinemas went from R98 to R107, and tickets for 2D shows went from R77 to R85, MyBroadband noted. Ster-Kinekor also brought the disparate pricing of its various cineplexes inline with one another. MyBroadband also pointed out that Ster-Kinekor no longer uses “Classic” and “Junction” to differentiate between its cinemas, but they remain useful terms to help group the company’s pricing tiers. Signs bearing the terms may also still be seen outside malls around South Africa, it said.  Nu Metro, MyBroadband noted, has not increased its prices since May 2018.  It should also be noted that Nu Metro and Ster-Kinekor have loyalty and partner programmes that offer discounts on tickets. Read: MTN launches MusicTime streaming service
