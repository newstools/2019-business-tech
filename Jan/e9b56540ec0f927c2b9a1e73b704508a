The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) has announced that it will be extending its operating hours from 2 – 11 January 2019 to keep up with demand over the busy holiday period. In a statement released on Thursday (3 January), the DHA said that several of its offices across the country will operate from 07h00 to 19h00. The department said the decision to extend operating hours came after long queues were experienced in some centres at the same time last year. “Extending office hours at large offices and selected medium offices will help ensure citizens and clients are not turned away before receiving the services they require,” said department spokesperson Siya Qoza. “This will assist also in managing queues so that people do not spend a long time waiting to be served.” Qoza further urged citizens to use this opportunity to collect their Smart ID cards if they have received a notification. “Those who have not applied for their smart ID cards are encouraged to capitalise on the extended hours and accordingly apply with speed, ahead of the general elections,” he said. “All other services will be offered, including applications for and collection of passports and registration of births, marriages and deaths”.
