The South African Post Office (SAPO) has released its updated list of fees for services across South Africa. The new fees will be implemented as of 1 April 2019 and will see an increase in the cost of sending of ordinary domestic and international mail, packages, as well as the purchasing of stamps. The SAPO has faced a difficult year with a nationwide industrial action in July 2018 leading to a months-long backlog for both local and international deliveries. This led to the Post Office dealing with inflows of close to 60 million deliveries at some points in 2018, said CEO Mark Barnes. The SAPO has laso been rocked by inefficiencies with recent testing by MyBroadband showing that a large number of letters are simply not delivered. You can find a detailed breakdown of the 2019 rates below. Domestic parcel rates Any postal item larger than 250 x 353 mm and/or thicker than 30mm and/or weighing more than 1 kg will be considered a ‘parcel’ by SAPO. It will also charge R56.80 for the first kilogram for counter to counter deliveries, with an additional R7.65 charged for each additional kg or part of a kg. Insurance is an optional extra, and the sender has the option of insuring the ordinary parcel at a rate of 3% of the declared value up to a maximum of R5,000 with a minimum rate of R4.55 per parcel.
