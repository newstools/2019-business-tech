Vodacom’s video streaming platform, Video Play, has secured the rights to livestream the 2018/19 FA Cup, offering viewers the chance to watch a game for R35. The new service also includes a Full Pass bundle for R249, which will enable users to live stream the next five rounds of the competition, while catch-up bundles showing highlights start at R15. According to the mobile operator, the service is an alternative for football fans who cannot afford the high cost of pay-TV subscriptions, bringing the pay per match fee as a first for the country. “We are aware that soccer fans are passionate and have the spirit to connect with one another when watching a game. We are also aware that many fans face the challenges that comes with the costs of high monthly pay TV subscription costs. We decided to put the FA Cup in our customers’ pockets, to allow them to watch their favourite teams, live in their own way. This is a first for South Africa where football fans can pay for the games that they want to watch from as little as R35 a match,” Vodacom said. Video Play will next livestream matches from the fourth round of the main tournament on Saturday 26 January 2019, concluding with the final in May 2019.
