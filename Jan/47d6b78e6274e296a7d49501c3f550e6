The all-new 2019 fifth-generation Toyota RAV4 is set to launch in South Africa in March 2019, according to CarMag. The RAV4 will reportedly consist of five derivatives at launch, and will not include a diesel version. “Instead, the engine line-up will comprise a 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit (with new outputs of 127 kW and 207 N.m) and a 2.5-litre power plant (now churning out 152 kW and 250 N.m) – both naturally aspirated petrol motors,” CarMag said, citing Toyota South Africa. Pricing is expected to be revealed closer to launch date, with the Rav4 expected to compete against the likes of the Nissan Qashqai, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage and Mazda CX-5. Currently the older generation starts from R393,800 for a 2.0 GX 2WD, while a 2.2 D VX AT AWD starts from R580,200.   Read: A look at the all new Toyota RAV4 coming to South Africa in 2019
