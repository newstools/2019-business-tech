It features 5 bedrooms, 8 bathrooms, and had a listing price of $20,995,000, though according to sales agents was sold for $20.5 million. The listing realtor, The Agency, describes the house as “the perfect marriage of innovation and sophistication”, with features such as polished glass floors, automatic walls of glass that “blur the line between indoors and out”. It has a custom saltwater aquarium, stone bar, cigar room and office, with a marble chef’s kitchen, custom cabinetry, and climate-controlled wine storage for up to 250 bottles. The master bedroom is just over 200 square metres, finished with oak floors, automated doors and Lutron shades. Additional amenities include a large den with a leather-finished marble fireplace, dining room with a weeping wall feature and butler’s kitchen, fully equipped theatre, maid’s quarters and cabana room.  According to TimesLive, Noah’s friend Sizwe Dhlomo recently tweeted an image of the Daily Show host’s new house, focusing on a pool that looks almost identical to the 19-metre long infinity pool showcased in the listed house.
