Integrated ICT and infrastructure provider Vox has partnered with Netstream and SA Digital Villages to broaden the reach and availability of its fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) offerings. In addition to using its own fibre infrastructure, through its Frogfoot subsidiary, Vox said that partnering with other fibre network operators helped to speed up the pace at which it can get customers connected, while also expand network coverage beyond core urban areas like Pietermaritzburg or Knysna. “We want to position ourselves as the internet service provider of choice for FTTH and the best way to do this is by extending our reach in the consumer market. Coupled with a 24/7/365 support desk, and having a presence in all major metropolitan areas enables us to service our customers more efficiently, aiding our expansion goals,” said Claire Williamson, senior product manager FTTH at Vox. Fibre connectivity through SA Digital Villages is available in selected areas in Gauteng, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and the North West, while Netstream provides services in Gauteng and the Western Cape. Combined, they will provide access to 50,000 additional ‘live’ homes, with around another 40,000 to go live over the course of 2019. There are several new plans for customers who will use infrastructure from Netstream or SA Digital Villages, with speeds ranging from 4Mbps to 100Mbps. All plans are uncapped and come with a free to use WiFi enabled router. The plans available are as follows: Netstream SADV There is an installation fee: for Netstream, it is R1,725 including VAT, and for SA Digital Villages it is either R999 or R1,725 depending on the user’s dwelling type.
