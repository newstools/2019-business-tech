A new high-tech e-sports and gaming facility, the ATK Arena launched in Cape Town at the end of 2018. With over 70 high-end setups and peripherals, the arena promises an admin-free experience allowing gamers to ‘sit down and go’ with the latest and best gaming hardware available. The arena also features a number of gaming consoles (attached to 4K televisions) as well as imported sim racing rigs for driving fans. Other features include a 500 mbps business fibre line and world-class streaming room. For catering purposes, the ATK Arena offers food from Hudson’s Burger Bar as well as a bar serving both cold and hot refreshments. “Most excitingly for the local gaming community is the monthly conversion of the lounge area into a tournament area,” the company said in a statement. “Complete with only the best competitive rigs, big screens, big sound and even a shout casting section, we aim to deliver what the South African esports scene has been needing: a permanent place for talented gamers to prove to the community and the world at large that we, as South Africans, have what it takes to compete with the best.” Pricing As per its website, the ATK Arena offers a number of different rates depending on the ‘enthusiasm’ level of gamers. The ‘Gamer’ package costs R600 monthly (no rollover) for a minimum of three months and comes with 20 hours loaded at the beginning of the month upon successful payment. Members then have the option to top-up option at R40 per hour once the 20 hours runs out. You are also allowed to bring one additional guest at R60 per hour. At the other end of the scale, the ‘Pro Gamer’ package has 60 hours loaded at the beginning of the month and you are allowed to bring two additional guests at R40 per hour per guest. For those not interested in gaming, an ATK Arena Member option exists which allows for access to the lounge and internet laptop bar at R300 a month. Read: Top 6 best-selling PC brands in the world
