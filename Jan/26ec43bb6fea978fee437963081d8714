President Cyril Ramaphosa is thinking of ways to keep former president Jacob Zuma closely tied to his government – where he can keep an eye on him. Speaking to the City Press, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa confirmed that Ramaphosa was contemplating a “Council of Elders” for the ANC, which would be made up of former presidents Zuma, Mbeki and Motlanthe. The council would play an advisory role on governance for both the party and the country. According to the paper, such a move could be interpreted as the current president trying to contain Zuma, after he re-entered the public sphere in recent weeks. Zuma still enjoys strong support, particularly in KwaZulu Natal, and it has been speculated that he is using that support to strong-arm Ramaphosa into supporting him with his legal fees. Ramaphosa insiders told the City Press that the president is wary of Zuma’s support base – particularly a host of new parties being started by Zuma supporters, which could be seen as an attempt to weaken the ANC’s performance in the 2019 elections, to spark backlash against Ramaphosa. Zuma’s presence in the ANC’s election campaign has been described as “a headache”, with some NEC members suggesting he either be found guilty of corruption and suspended, or deployed on diplomatic missions to other African countries.
