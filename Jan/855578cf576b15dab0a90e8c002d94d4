After a troubled year for the South African economy in 2018 – where households were placed under immense pressure due to a VAT hike and higher prices on almost every front – parents can expect steep hikes in the cost of private education in 2019. Parents can expect to pay much higher fees at South Africa’s top-tier private school this year, with an average fee hike among the 20 most expensive schools coming in at around 8.0%. A survey of twenty schools taken by the Sunday Times showed increases at state schools averaged 8.2% and hikes at private schools were on average 7.8% – significantly higher than the 5.0% inflation rate. When BusinessTech first started tracking the most expensive schools in 2014, only one school (Hilton College) was priced over R200,000 for boarding and tuition – now in 2019, over 20 schools have moved into that price range. Parents have become extremely sensitive to the rising costs of private education, with a noted increase in the number of parents who can no longer afford the school fees, and having to turn to financial aid. Private school groups, meanwhile, have noted a decline in learner numbers as parents pull their kids out of schools due to rising prices. The most expensive schools The African Leadership Academy, with an annual tuition fee over R400,000 is technically the most expensive school in the country – however, because it is not a traditional IEB or NSC institution, we have excluded it from this list. Hilton College in the KZN midlands retains its title as the most expensive school in the country, with its annual fees (which only allows for boarding) now coming close to R300,000 a year. Aside from the prestige, tradition, and beautiful facilities and grounds, the fees generally cover tuition, board, games, ordinary medical attention, the use of the sanatorium, library and laundry. It also includes basic entertainment which is arranged for learners, and transport for sporting and other events. It must be noted that most schools do not include additional fees in this amount. Additional fees can typically relate to various levies, such as IT and infrastructure, as well as further costs for food, extra mural activities and trips. MichaelHouse and St Anne’s have not published their 2019 fee schedules, but still remain among the most expensive schools based on their 2018 fees. Hilton College – R298,600  St Andrew’s College – R271,965  Roedean School for Girls – R270,006  St John’s College – R264,735  Bishops Diocesan College – R259,620  The most expensive boarding schools in South Africa (2019) The fees listed below are as they appear on the various schools’ web pages, and cover tuition and boarding. Fees are for the highest level of learning available. Day schools When taking out boarding options, the list of most expensive schools changes considerably (with MichaelHouse and Hilton removed, as they do not offer day school options). While R200,000 is the ‘benchmark’ level for expensive tuition and board, when it comes to tuition only, there are many schools that now charge over R100,000 a year. Kearsney College again ranks as the most expensive day school in the country with an annual tuition fee of just under R180,000. Kearsney College – R178,640  The most expensive day schools in South Africa (2019) The fees listed below are as they appear on the various schools’ web pages, and cover tuition only.
