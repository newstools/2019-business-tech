Nissan has unveiled the Nissan Leaf e+ which offers a new powertrain with additional power and range. The “e+” refers to the increased energy density of the model’s 62 kWh battery pack and the higher output of its powertrain. The new powertrain adds to the car’s range by approximately 40%, with EPA-estimated range of up to 226 miles (363 km), Nissan said. The Leaf e+ will be sold under the Leaf  Plus Series in the US and Canada, with each trim level receiving its own designation of S Plus, SV Plus and SL Plus. Globally, the vehicle will be referred to as the Nissan Leaf e+. More than 380,000 Nissan Leaf vehicles have been sold globally since the 100% electric model first went on sale in 2010, with over 128,000 sold in the US. The Leaf is equipped with advanced technologies including ProPILOT Assist semi-autonomous driving system and e-Pedal mode for one-pedal driving. The high-capacity battery and more powerful, 160 kW motor in the Leaf e+ combine to produce 45% more power and 250 lb-ft (340 Nm) of torque, enabling faster acceleration when driving at high speeds. Accelerating from 50 mph (80 kph) to 75 mph (120 kph) is nearly 13% quicker. The top speed has increased by approximately 10% for comfortable cruising. Thanks to the available new 70 kW (100 kW peak) Quick Charging system, the 2019 Nissan Leaf e+ can charge more efficiently than ever. Based on early testing, Nissan Leaf e+ owners can expect similar charging times when hooked up to a 100 kW charger as current Leaf owners do with a 50 kW charger, despite a 55% larger battery storage capacity. Even with a 25% increase in energy density and the increase in energy storage capacity, the Leaf e+ battery pack is almost the same size and configuration as the pack in the Nissan Leaf. Other than a 5-millimeter increase in overall height (16-inch wheels), the car’s exterior and interior dimensions are unchanged. The battery limited warranty of 8 years/160,000 km (whichever occurs first) is standard for all versions. It is unclear when the new Leaf will arrive in South Africa, however, Elon Musk stated on Twitter recently that Tesla would ‘probably’ open a dealership in South Africa at the end of 2019.
