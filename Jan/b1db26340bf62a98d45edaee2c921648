Former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is expected to drop a few bombs before the state capture commission this coming week – this time talking about former president Jacob Zuma and his allies Dudu Myeni and minister Nomvula Mokonyane. Agrizzi made headlines this week following shocking admissions made in testimony before the state capture commission, including details on how service provider Bosasa (now known as African Global Operation) bribed its way into state contracts. Several high-profile names popped up in his testimony – many of which were government officials – but the City Press reports that the big names are yet to come. According to the paper, which has reportedly seen a list of names that Agrizzi plans to mention in the coming week’s proceedings, the former executive will be giving details on how former president Jacob Zuma was paid ‘protection money’ by the group. Additionally, how former SAA chair Dudu Myeni – whose name has already turned up in proceedings – was paid monthly bribes, and how current Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane allegedly received cash gifts in exchange for work. Other people expected to be named are correctional services officers and some within the National Prosecuting Authority. The City Press said that sources close to Agrizzi implied that he has a slew of evidence to back his testimony, including CCTV footage and mirrored emails that were allegedly wiped from Bosasa’s servers. The ANC this week said that it fully supports the state capture commission and wouldn’t be outright supporting those of its members that are implicated in it.
