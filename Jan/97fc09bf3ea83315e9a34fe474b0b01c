Discovery Bank will begin gradually inviting additional clients to join its banking app from March this year. A spokesperson told BusinessTech that the bank has been testing and refining its banking capabilities, with early access given to some Discovery employees exclusively over the past two-and-a-half months. “We have been growing these numbers over the past few weeks, and are looking forward to inviting all Discovery employees to join shortly,” the bank said. “These early access clients have signed up digitally on the Discovery Bank app, testing our paperless FICA process, and unique facial recognition to create their individual profiles. Those of them who were Discovery Card holders were smoothly moved onto our banking platform.” Because of the digital nature of the bank, Discovery said that it has been able to test and release new functionality daily, with ‘highly-engaged employees’ making use of all the banking and reward features. “This enables us to rigorously test and fine-tune the functionality, as we work towards building our world-class banking experience,” Discovery said. “We’ve been delighted with the robust and lightning-quick performance of the app and the payment systems across the globe as our international testing of the card continues.” “As the testing progresses, we will be gradually inviting additional clients to join from March this year. “This is an exciting time and we are growing every day in a safe and responsible manner. New and exciting benefits will be added to the core functionality through our agile development cycles, with the ability to innovate rapidly on the platform,” it said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-296272 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Discovery-iPhone-509x1024.png" alt="" width="509" height="1024" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Discovery-iPhone-509x1024.png 509w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Discovery-iPhone-149x300.png 149w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Discovery-iPhone-768x1545.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Discovery-iPhone-1200x2414.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Discovery-iPhone.png 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 85vw, 509px" /> Features Discovery said that its app is aimed at being a ‘branch in the palm of people’s hands’ and will offer a number of unique features.
