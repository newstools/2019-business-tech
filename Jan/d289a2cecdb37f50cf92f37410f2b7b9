The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) introduced new alcohol testing machines over the festive season. Speaking to 702, JMPD senior superintendent, Wayne Minnaar said that the new breathalysers will immediately print out their readings – negating the need for any additional blood tests. “The new system can be adjusted for males and females and can also account for the age of the person,” Minnaar said. “What is more important is that we comply with the operational requirements as approved by the DPP (Director of Public Prosecutions).” Minaar explained that these requirements include a docket containing: The officer’s statement;
The operator’s statement;
A certified copy of the operator’s certificate;
A certified copy of the calibration certificate;
Aa certified copy of approval;
A printout;
A warning statement which has to be given to the accused as to why they have been arrested. “All of this has to be complied with and what we like about the new machine is that a gives a printout right there and then without a blood sample,” he said. “One copy is given to the driver, a second is attached the docket, and the other three copies are kept on file for when the case goes to court.” Minaar added that the previous system relied solely on blood samples which were often not presented timeously. This meant that many cases never even reached the court, he said. Read: Major new road rules proposed for South Africa
