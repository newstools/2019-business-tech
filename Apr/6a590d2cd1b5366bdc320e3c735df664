Shoprite says it is still accepting bursary applications for the 2019 academic year. Accounting (first and second year), Logistics, IT and Data Sciences as well as Retail Business Management students have a chance at being awarded a bursary of up to R70,000, by completing an online application, it said. Last year some 286 students benefited from the Shoprite bursary programme, which translated to an investment in excess of R15 million. Each bursary comes with a work-back agreement, which would see the successful applicant assured of a job at the largest private sector employer in the country once they’ve graduated. Trainee Accountant Mpilo Sicwebu was a Shoprite bursary holder for the full duration of his university career at Wits: “I was unable to secure a bursary in my matric year. So in my first year I was conducting an online search when I found the Shoprite bursary programme,” said the 23-year-old Sicwebu, who is originally from Durban. Now an accounting article clerk at Shoprite’s Home Office, he said no two work days are ever the same. “I expected an every-man-for-himself environment, but was surprised to find something totally different. Everyone here is so accessible and willing to help me grow and develop.” It’s been 21 years since the Shoprite Group became the first retailer in South Africa to receive accreditation as a training office from the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA). Sicwebu is one of 30 candidates currently doing their articles at Shoprite. It is not only accounting students that benefit from a structured programme once they join the Group. A graduate programme is rolled out to all bursary holders employed by the retailer upon graduation, Shoprite said. Read: Sasol’s insane bursary is now open to candidates – here’s what it includes
