Pam Golding is marketing a unique property on Cape Town’s South Peninsula – made entirely from shipping containers. The home owners conducted extensive research of container home construction, both in SA and internationally – to ensure that it meets National Home Builders Registration Council standards and is fully compliant, Pam Golding said. “Drone footage and 3-D modelling software allowed for a holistic understanding of the building site, and the construction requirements,” it said. Seven shipping containers were welded together to create an elevated, double-volume structure with 180-degree views of the sea and mountain. “Containers are increasingly being accepted as a form of durable building material, and are seen as being on a par with brick for longevity,” Pam Golding said. The aim of the project was to create a home that was not only sensitive to the environment, but that was consciously made of repurposed and upcycled material. “Who would have thought that a squash court, the stern of a pirate ship from a movie set and discarded flag poles from Hout Bay could find a new lease on life in a contemporary container home that has become somewhat of an attraction in this South Peninsula suburb,” it said. Upcycling is evident throughout – from the Oregon pine floors reclaimed from a heritage property in Stellenbosch, to the woodchips used outside that were taken from stables in Noordhoek. “The clever use of reclaimed materials means that the home exudes a sense of understated luxury. A customized kitchen, with ample space for entertaining, has top-end finishes. Three of the four upstairs bedrooms boast panoramic sea and mountain views. Repurposed figureheads, taken from a film set, add a touch of dramatic glamour as the frames for bathroom mirrors,” the property firm noted. Pam Golding Properties is marketing this home in Glencairn Heights, for R5.175 million. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310810" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome.png" alt="" width="1033" height="641" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome.png 1033w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome-300x186.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome-768x477.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome-1024x635.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310816" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome2.png" alt="" width="1056" height="681" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome2.png 1056w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome2-300x193.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome2-768x495.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome2-1024x660.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310820" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome4.png" alt="" width="999" height="714" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome4.png 999w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome4-300x214.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome4-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310822" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome5.png" alt="" width="1017" height="671" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome5.png 1017w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome5-300x198.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome5-768x507.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310824" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome6.png" alt="" width="1057" height="692" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome6.png 1057w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome6-300x196.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome6-768x503.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome6-1024x670.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310826" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome7.png" alt="" width="1062" height="676" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome7.png 1062w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome7-300x191.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome7-768x489.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome7-1024x652.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310828" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome8.png" alt="" width="1114" height="688" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome8.png 1114w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome8-300x185.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome8-768x474.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome8-1024x632.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310830" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome9.png" alt="" width="950" height="684" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome9.png 950w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome9-300x216.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ContainerHome9-768x553.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <span style="display: inline-block;
