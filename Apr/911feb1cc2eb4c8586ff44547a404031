Specialist recruitment firm, Michael Page, has released its salary survey for Q1 2019 – showing that South Africa’s job market is very unpredictable. Despite a short recovery observed in South Africa in the first half of 2018 and the emergence from a recession with a +2.2% GDP growth in the third quarter, the official unemployment rate is back at its 2017 level, the group said. “This is due to weak investment & consumer confidence, along with continued limited household spending & private investment. “With the economic stimulus package announced in September 2018 and a heightened commitment to attract foreign investment, we are expecting a positive economic impact on the GDP growth and the unemployment rate for 2019.” While the majority of sectors remain under pressure, the group said the significant drivers will come from the Banking & Financial Services, IT and Transportation sectors.
