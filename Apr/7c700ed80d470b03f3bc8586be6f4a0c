The Department of Home Affairs has warned of ‘election robbers’ who are targeting members of the public ahead of the 2019 national elections. The department said that the scammers pretend to be Home Affairs officials so they can gain access to homes. “They are in possession of letterheads purportedly from the Department of Home Affairs and claim the purpose of their visit is to confirm the validity of IDs for the elections,” said acting Home Affairs director-general Thulani Mavuso. “They then rob the unsuspecting members of the public of their valuables. There is no initiative of this nature from Home Affairs. “We don’t come to your homes to validate your IDs, you come to us, as citizens, for IDs and other services.” Mavuso cautioned members of the South African public to be extra vigilant in the run-up to the national elections on 8 May.
