The recent Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany provided an opportunity to see the latest ideas and innovations in aircraft designs. More than 1,000 airline attendees and 16,000+ key aviation decision-makers from across the globe visited the event, with designs from the expo set to provide an idea of what aircraft will look like in the future. Below BusinessTech looked at some of the most notable designs. Using the cargo hold for more space <img class="size-full wp-image-309246 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Airbus.png" alt="" width="1182" height="586" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Airbus.png 1182w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Airbus-300x149.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Airbus-768x381.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Airbus-1024x508.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Airbus won the coveted Crystal Cabin award for its “Lower Deck Pax Experience” modules. The Lower Deck Pax Experience Modules allows for the extension of passengers’ space into the cargo hold – allowing for beds, stretching, playground and business areas. “The modules would fit inside aircraft cargo compartments, offer new opportunities for additional services to passengers, improving their experience while enabling airlines to differentiate and add value for their commercial operations,” Airbus said. “The new passenger modules could be easily interchangeable with regular cargo containers if required, as aircraft cargo floors and cargo loading systems would not be affected – the passenger module would sit directly on it.” Awesome reading lights <img class="aligncenter wp-image-309272 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Reading-light-1024x638.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="523" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Reading-light-1024x638.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Reading-light-300x187.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Reading-light-768x478.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Reading-light-1200x747.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Collins Aerospace won plaudits for its ‘uLED reading light’. The light can project almost any shape of light beam imaginable, providing targeted light for reading at several seats at the same time. It also has the potential to act as a dome light that works in tandem with the overall cabin lighting system to create different ambiences, such as bright for boarding and dim for night. Available with full-color options, the light can also illuminate a row of tray tables and the passenger floor area, eliminating the need for sidewall lighting. ‘Standing seats’ <img class="aligncenter wp-image-309242 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Avio-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Avio-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Avio-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Avio-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Avio-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Arguably the most notable design at the show was Aviointerior’s Skyrider 2.0  ‘standing seat’ which allows for an ultra-high density in the aircraft cabin. The aim of the seat is to open the travelling experience to a wider passenger market, creating also a useful space for the introduction mixed classes boarded on the same aircraft. Its main feature is the original bottom that ensures an increased upright passenger position allowing installation of the seat at a reduced pitch, while maintaining an ‘adequate comfort’. “The design of this seat enables to increase the passenger number by 20% allowing increasing profits for airline companies, said Aviointeriors. “Furthermore, Skyrider 2.0 weighs 50% less than standard economy class seats and the reduced number of components enable minimum maintenance costs.” Comfortable long-haul trips <img class="aligncenter wp-image-309254 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Recaro-seat-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Recaro-seat-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Recaro-seat-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Recaro-seat-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Recaro-seat-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Seat manufacturer, Recaro was recognised as part of the Crystal Cabin awards for its long-haul seat design. The design aims to make economy class travel more pleasant thanks to neck support and adjustable cushioning for the seat and backrest. Super luxurious suites <img class="aligncenter wp-image-309260 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Peacock-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Peacock-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Peacock-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Peacock-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Peacock-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> This futuristic concept from Paperclip Design is aimed at being flexible, and luxurious. The company’s ‘Peacock suites’ promise a variable configuration of first-class cabins, from family compartments with a bunk bed, to a three-room luxury suite. Full-height curtains, effective in blocking lights and sounds, let passengers gain full control of their own experience and schedule without disturbing others. Other possible configurations include a super wide couch and face-to-face dining all for people to enjoy the company of close friends and family.
