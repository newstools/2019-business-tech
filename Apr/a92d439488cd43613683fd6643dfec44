Parliament has released its register of members interests for 2018 – detailing all the shares, properties, businesses and gifts declared by South African politicians. “The work of the committee is to create public trust and confidence in public representatives and to protect the integrity of Parliament,” it said. “The production of this register also reinforces accountability.” While the register has some notable omissions, there are a number of clear trends that emerge when it comes to the types of gifts that South African politicians receive. Alcohol and event tickets are some of the most popular gifts, while a number of parliamentarians also received smartphones, clothing and livestock. With the full register now available to the public, BusinessTech looked at some of the most notable, expensive and unusual gifts that were declared and how much they cost.
