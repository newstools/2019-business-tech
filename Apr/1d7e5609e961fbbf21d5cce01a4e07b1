Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: President Cyril Ramaphosa says that some of the findings coming from the state capture commission are actionable, and that those who are found to be guilty of fraud and corruption must face jail time. [Daily Maverick] Damning testimony is expected to be delivered before the state capture commission, explaining how ANC SG Ace Magashule ran the Free State into the ground. Magashule is in the spotlight after a new investigative book underlined his role in the capture of the province. [Mail & Guardian] Two of former president Jacob Zuma’s top advocates have bailed on representing him, as he fights for a permanent stay of prosecution to avoid over 20 years of jail time. The case is around Zuma’s actions in the arms deal from the 90s. [Business Day] The ANC is surprised that its election list is so controversial. Party SG Ace Magashule said that the lists were determined democratically and rigorously since September 2018. The list contains names accused of corruption, and some found by the courts to have violated their oaths of office. [ENCA] South Africa’s rand firmed on Thursday, eking out gains late in the session as hopes of a trade deal between the United States and China bolstered risk appetite globally.
