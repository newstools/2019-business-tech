Growing business This is not the first insurance-based service that Vodacom has launched – it also also provides funeral and device cover. This diversification is likely to be important for the company going forward, with a Vodacom spokesperson stating that the legal service has already acquired approximately 35,000 customers since launch. “The service provides customers with a 24-hour telephonic legal advice, manned by qualified and experienced in-house attorneys for guidance and information on all legal matters,” the spokesperson said. “The in-house attorneys provide assistance across a broad scope of legal concerns and situations 24/7 throughout the year including public holidays.” He said that the legal service spectrum covers the following: Marriage mediation;
Family mediation;
Debt advice;
Contractual matters;
Criminal matters;
