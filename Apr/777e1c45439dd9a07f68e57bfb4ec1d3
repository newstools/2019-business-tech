Eskom’s chief operating officer Jan Oberholzer has been appointed to the board of directors of international research organisation the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The power utility said in a statement that a seat on the board gives Eskom direct access to some of the most cutting edge energy research available, and offered the company a position to influence EPRI’s strategic direction and work programme. EPRI conducted research and development related to the generation, delivery, and use of electricity for the benefit of the public. EPRI’s international participation extended to more than 30 countries, including South Africa. “We wish to congratulate Mr Oberholzer on his appointment as part of the board at EPRI. This gives him an opportunity to further serve the broader energy industry over and above his responsibility of serving Eskom and South Africa,” Eskom group chief executive Phakamani Hadebe said.
