Gerhard van der Linde, MD from Seeff Pretoria East, says while the face of estates has changed significantly in recent years and they are now coming in many shapes, sizes and price ranges, they are generally still priced higher than traditional residential property. “Buyers who can afford it are willing to pay a premium for homes in security estates. That being said, the price of properties within the same estate can differ greatly, depending on the erf size, position within the estate itself, the size of the dwelling and the finishes. “Pricing in an estate tends to increase steadily as homes are built, with prices reaching premium when little to no vacant stands remains in the estate available to buy to build on,” said van der Linde. Steve van Wyk, Seeff’s MD in Centurion, says while Centurion is home to very expensive estates, there are options in every price range, some estates priced from as low as R1.5 million. These however are not luxury estates and mainly offer entry level property. “While alternatives like boomed off areas could offer slightly better security and enhanced peace of mind, they are poor substitutes for a genuine security estate that is manned 24 hours a day and has access control. This is the main reason why estate living in South Africa will continue to grow in popularity.” Seeff took a look at the luxury estates in both Centurion and Pretoria East and here are the findings: Luxury Estates where you can comfortably buy a property for less than R5 million Centurion Golf Estate The average price of a property based on the most recent freehold sales that took place here is just over R3.7 million.
