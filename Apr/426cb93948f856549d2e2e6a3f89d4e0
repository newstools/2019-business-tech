As Ford Mustang celebrates its 55th anniversary this week – the US carmaker has revealed how many units it has sold in South Africa since 2016 – more than 2,600. Ford pointed out that the Mustang was the world’s best-selling sports coupe of 2018 on the strength of 113,066 cars sold. Mustang’s market share in the global sports car segment is up half a point for 2018 over the previous year – to 15.4% – fuelled in part by the Bullitt – a limited edition Mustang that was launched to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a Steve McQueen film that shares the same name, in which he drove the original 1968 Mustang GT Fastback. The Bullitt is due for release in South Africa this year. “Ford’s galloping pony remains one of the best-selling sports cars in South Africa having sold 2,615 units since it went on sale locally in 2016, the car maker said. “We broke the mould when Ford launched the Mustang 55 years ago,” said Jim Farley, Ford president, global markets. “Nothing says freedom, the wind in your hair and the joy of driving like Mustang; it’s an icon. The roar of its V8 on a spring day, there’s nothing better. No wonder it’s the most popular sports coupe in the world.” Mustang was available for purchase in 146 markets in 2018, based on worldwide Ford sales data. More than 500,000 sixth-generation Mustangs have been sold worldwide since 2015, with the pony picking up an additional half point of global share last year to capture 15.4% of the segment. This was fuelled in part by the new Mustang Bullitt, which exceeded global sales forecasts by 25%. The Mustang starts from R728,500 ($26,395 in the US) for an 2.3 EcoBoost Fastback, rising to R955,800 ($39,355 in theUS) for a 5.0 V8 Auto Convertible. The Bullitt meanwhile, starts at $46,595 (R653,000) in the US, although it is unclear how much it will cost upon arrival in South Africa.
