MTN recently published its integrated annual report, revealing how much its top executives got paid in the financial year ended December 2018. The group paid its top two executives a total of R65.46 million for the year, with other prescribed officers taking a combined R176.96 million for a total of R242.4 million. Group CEO, Rob Shuter earned R42.92 million, including a basic salary of R15.28 million and bonuses and other benefits exceeding R26 million. Across the listed mobile operators, MTN’s Shuter was not the highest paid in 2018, however, with Vodacom boss Shameel Joosub taking home a much larger salary. For the year ended March 2018, Joosub was paid R50.3 million for the year – while Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko was paid just over half as much at R27.2 million. A 2018 report by remuneration consultancy 21st Century found that CEOs at large cap companies earn an average basic salary of R5.35 million, with short-term and long-term incentives averaging 71% (R3.8 million) and 222% of that amount (R11.9 million), respectively. This bring the total average package for a large cap CEO at R21 million.
