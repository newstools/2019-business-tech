In his recent state of the city address, Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina said that the city is in the process of constructing three new mega projects – namely John Dube, Daggafontein and Leeuwpoort. The new cities, backed by the Gauteng government and the Department of Human Settlements, will have a total yield of 50,571 units, aimed at addressing the need for affordable housing in the area, he said. These ‘mega projects’ are just three of 30 earmarked for Gauteng, where the provincial government aims to undo the historic settlement patterns of the apartheid era. Masina said that 26,000 low-cost houses have been built over the last two years, with a vision to have the 50,571 units by 2021. A number of projects have been in the pipeline since before 2017, but were neatly compiled into an investment document in June 2018, and outlined by the Department of Human Settlements’ Gauteng Partnership Fund (GPF). “Mega projects emerge as a corrective measure for the challenges encountered in the first ten to fifteen years of the democratic South Africa,” the GPF said. “The initiative seeks to close the gaps, whilst redefining future cities in line with the dictates of the National Development Plan, and the Gauteng City Region (GCR) strategy.” According to the development plan for the project, the mega cities project is a R100-billion economic corridor investment, which ultimately aims to deliver more than 800,000 houses within 30 residential developments spread across the five development corridors in Gauteng. These corridors are: The Central Development Corridor – anchored on the city of Johannesburg as the hub of finance, services, information and communication technology, and pharmaceutical industries;
The Eastern Development Corridor – built around the economy of the Ekurhuleni metro as the hub of manufacturing, logistics and transport industries;
The Northern Development Corridor – anchored on Tshwane as the administrative capital city and the hub of the automotive sector, research, development, innovation and the knowledge-based economy;
The Western Corridor – encompassing the economy of the West Rand district and the creation of new industries, new economic nodes and new cities; and
The Southern Corridor – encompassing the economy of the Sedibeng district and the creation of new industries, new economic nodes and new cities. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-309146" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects.png" alt="" width="1284" height="717" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects.png 1284w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects-300x168.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects-768x429.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects-1024x572.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects-1200x670.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The plan involves the redevelopment of cities in areas of existing infrastructure, as well as drawing investment into developing infrastructure in new areas.
