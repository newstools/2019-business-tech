FNB customers can now shop using eBucks in their banking app. The eBucks shop, which was previously only accessible on the eBucks website, offers customers exclusive pricing for products ranging from tech and gaming to appliances and outdoor. The bank said that it has over 2.8 million active app users in South Africa and more than 700,000 average visits per month to the eBucks rewards tab. “In the near future, customers can expect to access more meaningful and integrated innovations under the eBucks tab on the FNB app to meet a range of lifestyle needs including travel,” the bank said. To access and start shopping on the app, customers must have an existing eBucks account and have the latest version of the FNB/RMB app. Read: 2 awesome new features you will see from Capitec soon
