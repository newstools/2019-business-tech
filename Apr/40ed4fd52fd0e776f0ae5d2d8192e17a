Estate living is one of the fastest growing property trends in South Africa, according to property group Seeff, boosted by the demand for a quality lifestyle in a secure environment. Data from property research firm, Lightstone shows that there are about 6,500 gated and estate properties in South Africa with a quarter of these located in the Western Cape and over half in Gauteng. Estate property sales comprise of about 5% of all sales in volume terms and around 15% of the overall property market value, Lightstone said, noting that prices tend to average at nearly three times the national average price. According to Seeff, the Western Cape is home to some of the most luxurious estates in the country, with prices extending beyond R20 million. Samuel Seeff, chairman of the Seeff Property Group, said that while being able to enjoy a rural lifestyle, residents are still within easy reach of main business nodes, the international airport, and top schools. “Additionally, the estates also offer many unique features such as wineries and vineyards, olive groves, eco-trails, and equestrian facilities in addition to lifestyle, clubhouse and golfing facilities which are often found in estates,” he said. For the luxury of a quality lifestyle and top security, buyers are often prepared to pay a premium of 20%-40%, according to Seeff, and it is not uncommon for top homes to sell for millions – especially in high-end country estates in the Constantia Valley, and in the Cape Winelands, especially Franschhoek, Stellenbosch and Paarl. These are the top 10 country estates in the Cape, according to Seeff, including how much you can expect to pay to live there.
