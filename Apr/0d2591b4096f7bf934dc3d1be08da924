This brings the full-year increase in the total dividend to 14%. “We continue to invest in our business given our confidence in its long-term growth prospects,” chief executive officer, Francois Gouws. “Specifically, investment in technology resulted in a 29% increase in related costs, while personnel costs also increased markedly from the previous year mainly due to an  increase in technology staff hires and 68 newly qualified graduates – 88% of which are ACI candidates. The graduates we hired are part of our continued strategy to build our own talent. ” PSG Konsult had 254 adviser offices and 2,886 employees as at 28 February 2019, which included 932 wealth and insure advisers. A further 417 were professional associates (accountants and attorneys). During the year under review, the number of PSG advisers increased by 148 through  a combination of organic growth and selected acquisitions, including the AIFA acquisition by PSG Insure. “We believe strongly in building our  own future talent and are confident that the investment in our people will allow us to continue to prosper,” Gouws said. Looking ahead, the chief executive said that the cash-generative nature of the business gives PSG Konsult several options for funding business growth initiatives and optimising risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. “As such, the group remains confident about the prospects for continued growth. The group will continue to prioritise organic growth in our selected markets where we have a relatively low, but rapidly expanding market share. “The group will continue to focus on initiatives that enable us to service clients in an integrated manner that is seamless and market-leading. The group’s focus on products, platforms, client service excellence and the quality of its advice process remains a key initiative,” Gouws said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-312080" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PSGKonsult.png" alt="" width="689" height="436" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PSGKonsult.png 689w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PSGKonsult-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: PSG Konsult interim headline earnings up 18%
