Huawei officially launched its P30 range of smartphones in South Africa on Wednesday (3 April), with the handsets available to purchase from local operators. The P30 range includes the flagship P30 and P30 Pro smartphones, with the P30 Lite aimed towards the mid-range market. Huawei also launched an e-commerce store which will sell these new models at recommended retail price (RRP). Cash prices currently listed for the devices on Huawei’s new website are as follows: Huawei P30 Lite – R5,999
Huawei P30 – R13,999
Huawei P30 Pro – R18,999 Speaking to BusinessTech Huawei South Africa chief technology officer, Akhram Mohamed, said that the store would only offer prepaid deals. This means that customers looking to purchase a Huawei on a contract will have to turn to local operators such as MTN and Vodacom. BusinessTech looked at the latest contract deals for the P30 Pro from these two operators, and how they compare to Samsung and Apple’s flagship handsets.
