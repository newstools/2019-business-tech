MTN says it has carried out extensive radio and transmission upgrades on its network to assist with the increase in network traffic over the Easter weekend. In areas expecting high visitor volumes, MTN SA said it has boosted its network capacity and expanded coverage in rural areas as it expects the demand for its services to soar. These include rolling out new base stations to remote areas that were without connectivity before; and performing technology upgrades on selected 3G and 4G/LTE base stations in major national roads, urban and rural parts of the country, in addition to the installation of L900 technology on most sites. In tourist and holiday hotspot areas such as Cape Town, Durban and other destinations, including Moria and N1 North in Limpopo, MTN said it expects the network upgrades to result in sustained and good network performance during increased traffic demand periods. “The investment MTN South Africa has made in its network over the past several years has left the operator fully prepared for the expected shift and increase in Easter season voice, SMS, and data traffic. “We will be optimising the network according to traffic demand in real-time, and we remain confident that everyone will experience a seamless experience on South Africa’s best network,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, Executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA. In addition, the deployment of temporary mobile base stations will provide added capacity in areas where the installation of permanent sites is incomplete, or where temporary capacity is required, the operator said.
