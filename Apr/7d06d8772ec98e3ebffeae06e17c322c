As all economic indicators point downward, politicians are stuck making promises to everyone, while being unable to deliver on them to anyone. [Mail & Guardian] The call for data prices to drop has become much louder following a Competition Commission report that prices are too high in South Africa. Civil groups are calling for Vodacom and MTN to drop prices immediately. [ENCA] Cosatu says that it’s open to discussing job cuts at Eskom – but only if it is provided with proof that the utility is overstaffed and that by reducing staff it is able to save it. The union wants these facts and figures made public.

However, while a split is unlikely, a longer battle over the future of the party and where it is headed in terms of policy is probably on the cards. [Times Live] South Africa’s rand turned flat in late afternoon trade on Thursday, but hovered near a four-week low hit earlier in the session on the back of a firmer dollar, while stocks fell. On Friday the rand was at R14.37 to the dollar, R18.54 to the pound and R16.00 to the euro.
