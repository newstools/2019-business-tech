The 1st of April marks the start of the financial year for many businesses and is historically the date when government institutes a number of new taxes. While this will mean some good news – including the zero-rating of some items such as sanitary pads and bread flour – the most notable changes are the new increases you can expect to see from this week. In the public sector this will include new fuel taxes and electricity increases, while in the private sector DStv has also announced price increases. These price hikes will be particularly hard for some South Africans who are still recovering from the effects of load shedding and a difficult year for the economy. BusinessTech looked at some of the most notable increases below and how they will impact your finances. Fuel taxes On Sunday (31 March), energy minister Jeff Radebe announced the adjustment of fuel prices for April 2019, with motorists to be hit hard as a result of rising global oil prices, a weaker rand and the introduction of new fuel taxes. “April is an important month in the fuel price calendar to revise road and pipelines tariffs as well as fuel and Road Accident Fund (RAF) levies, to be implemented into the price structures of petrol, diesel and Illuminating paraffin (IP),” the Department of Energy said. “Their total contributions to the fuel price increase is about 26.00c/l in Gauteng whilst the international factors amounted to about 106.00c/l on petrol and 56.00c/l on diesel and IP,” it said. The fuel prices for April 2019 will be adjusted as follows in Gauteng: Petrol (93 Octane): R1.34 increase;
Petrol (95 Octane): R1.31 increase;
Diesel (0.05% sulphur): 81.70 cents;
Illuminating Paraffin (wholesale): 63 cents. The price of 95 unleaded goes up by R1.26 per litre at the coast, while the price of 93 unleaded goes up by R1.29 per litre. Diesel 0.05% increases by 76 cents per litre at the coast. Here is what you can expect to pay from 3 April:
