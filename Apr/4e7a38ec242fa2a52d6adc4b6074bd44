Even Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, sometimes battles to wrap his head around the vast wealth he has created for himself. Speaking in an interview with the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, Dangote said that in recent times he doesn’t pay attention to his bank balance – but that wasn’t always the case. “When you first start a business your target is to make your first million,” he said. “After a year or so I realised that I have much more than that, however, all these numbers were just written out.” Wanting to see the money for himself, Dangote went to a bank and wrote and cashed a cheque for $10 million. “I put it in the boot of my vehicle and I went home and looked at it. Now I believe I have money,” he said. Dangote then took the money back to the bank the next day and deposited it all back. Africa’s richest man Dangote has a net worth of approximately $16.4 billion as head of Dangote Industries, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. He is among just a few Nigerian billionaires, most of whom accrued their wealth by coming into possession of lucrative oil blocks or, in the case of telecom magnate Mike Adenuga, providing services to a fast-growing population. The Lagos, Nigeria-based Dangote Industries owns sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest cement producer, Dangote Cement, which had revenue of 805.6 billion naira ($2.4 billion) in 2017. It also has interests in sugar, salt, flour, fertiliser and packaged food. You can watch the conversation on Dangote’s wealth below:  Read: MacKenzie Bezos to be fourth-richest woman after divorce
