Data published by financial services company Wesbank shows that the average amount spent on financing a new vehicle in South Africa is around R314,000. This is a significant jump compared to this same period last year, where the average spent on financing a new vehicle was R298,000. These annual increases in the cost of owning a car – combined with significant petrol increases in recent months – means that a number of South Africans are finding it increasingly difficult to own their own vehicle. Some respite can be found in the used car market, however, and Wesbank said that it finances more than double the number of used cars when compared to new cars. Notably, there are a fair number of new vehicles on the market that you can still buy for under R150,000. BusinessTech looked at some of these cars below.
