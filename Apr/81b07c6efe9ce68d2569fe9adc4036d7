Afrasia Bank has released a new report on global wealth – looking at the investments, habits, and hobbies of the world’s richest people. The report showed that art collecting is currently the most popular pastime for high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) – those individuals with wealth exceeding $1 million. Over the past few years cycling, watch collecting, fly-fishing and car collecting have also become more popular, whilst golf, tennis and horses have become less popular among the world’s wealthy. These are the most popular hobbies right now according to interviews conducted with HNWI intermediaries: Art collecting <img class="size-full wp-image-312402 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting.png" alt="" width="1225" height="772" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting.png 1225w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-300x189.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-768x484.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-1024x645.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Painting-1200x756.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Afrasia Bank estimates that the global top-end art market is valued at around $75 billion. “According to our in-house indices, global fine art prices have risen by 18% over the past 10 years (in US$ terms),” the bank said. “Globally the leading artists (in terms of price) include the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet, Rembrandt, Renoir, Cezanne, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Gustav Klimt. “The ‘Mona Lisa’ by Leonardo da Vinci and ‘Starry Night’ by Vincent van Gogh are arguably the most valuable paintings in the world. However, neither of them have ever come up for auction. They are considered priceless.” Watch collecting <img class="size-full wp-image-312404 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Patek.png" alt="" width="1440" height="886" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Patek.png 1440w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Patek-300x185.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Patek-768x473.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Patek-1024x630.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Patek-1200x738.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Popular watch brands for collectors include the likes of: Patek Philippe, Breguet and Vacheron Constantin. “Vacheron Constantin is considered to be the oldest watch maker in the world – it was founded in 1755,” said Afrasia Bank. “Patek Philippe, which was founded about 100 years later (in 1851) tends to achieve the highest prices, both for classic watches and new watches.” Classic cars <img class="size-full wp-image-236117 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ferrari-250-Testa-Rossa.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ferrari-250-Testa-Rossa.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ferrari-250-Testa-Rossa-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ferrari-250-Testa-Rossa-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “The global classic car market is valued at around $5 billion,” said Afrasia Bank. “According to our in-house indices, classic car prices rose by a strong 150% over the past 10 years (in US$ terms), making it the best performing investment class for wealthy people globally.” Popular classic cars for wealthy car enthusiasts worldwide are listed below (ranked by price in US$).
