New data from research group Lightstone highlights four Johannesburg inner-city properties that have shows stable and strong price growth in a nationally tough market. According to Lightstone, the suburbs offer properties within a wide band – from R650,000 to over R3 million – but have all shown positive price growth. This includes La Rochelle, where prices range from R650,000 to R1.5 million, showing 6.4% price growth in 2018, and Bellvue East, where prices are lower than R650,000, with price growth over 5.4%. The upper-end suburbs – Killarney and Houghton Estate – show lower positive price growth, but come off a much higher base, where property prices range from R1.5 million to well over R3 million, Lightstone said. Sandra Gordon, a senior research analyst at Pam Golding Properties, highlighted the surprising growth in Bellvue in particular. The analyst noted that between April 2018 to March 2019, a total of nine freehold properties were sold at an average price of R825,000 while 31 sectional title units were sold at an average price of R317,000. “Bellevue East is an unusually stable market, with 62% of existing homeowners having owned their properties for more than 11 years. Most of these owners are mature and middle-aged, with 40% of existing owners falling into each of these age categories. “A further 16% were retirees, while the balance is made up of first-time buyers,” she said. In sharp contrast, Lightstone data shows that over the same period, 66% of buyers were young adults (35 years or younger) – many of whom were presumably purchasing their first home. Bellevue East has a total of 857 homes which are fairly evenly distributed between freehold (48%) and sectional title (52%) units. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-313302" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Top-growth.png" alt="" width="748" height="333" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Top-growth.png 2126w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Top-growth-300x133.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Top-growth-768x342.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Top-growth-1024x456.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Top-growth-1200x534.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Inner city popularity According to Pam Golding, the Johannesburg inner city is a very active market, particularly for first-time buyers.
