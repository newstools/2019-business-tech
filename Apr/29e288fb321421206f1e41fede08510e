Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: The ANC ethics committee is looking at 22 party members who have had questions raised about them, including deputy president David Mabuza and mining minister Gwede Mantashe. Among the names are those that were reportedly handed to the IEC regarding their election eligibility. [City Press] Comments from Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago have put a damper on hopes that South Africa could see rate cuts this year. The governor said that while inflation expectations have declined, he wants to see evidence of future inflation numbers being lower. [Business Day] ANC secretary general Ace Magashule has been accused of vote buying, after he gave a voter R400 while campaigning in the Western Cape. The DA lodged a formal complaint with the IEC over the matter, and if found guilty, Magashule could be fined. [EWN] Former president Jacob Zuma is again defending his ‘nine wasted years’, saying that critics who pin policy uncertainty on his time as president are wrong. In particular, he pointed to senior party leaders who are making the claims, saying they were part of the processes and outcomes they now criticise. [Mail & Guardian] South Africa’s rand weakened past the threshold of R14.00 to the dollar early on Friday on data pointing to weak economic growth, but pulled back below those levels by the close of the week. On Monday, the rand was at R13.94 to the dollar, R18.26 to the pound and R15.78 to the euro.
