A Democratic Alliance (DA) ward councillor has highlighted a spelling blunder on an ANC election billboard in Port Elizabeth. Renaldo Gouws shared a photo on social media showing an ANC billboard in Nelson Mandela Bay. “Many of these have popped up around Nelson Mandela Bay today,” he said, below an apparent image of the billboard spelling “together” incorrectly.   Billboards are a massive election tool in South Africa, with many of the country’s larger parties forking out millions to splash their election promises and slogans for all to see. The DA courted controversy earlier in the year with a pre-election campaign claiming that the “ANC is killing us” on a billboard listing the names of the lives lost in the Marikana and Life Esidimeni tragedies. The board was ripped up within a day of being erected. With electioneering now in full swing, there have been several instances of party billboards and posters being defaced, ripped up or removed. According to the Independent Electoral Commission, beyond the act of vandalism, interfering with political election campaigns in this manner is in breach of the Electoral Code of Conduct and is an electoral offence. If it is found that political parties are behind the removal of posters, they could be fined, or even face imprisonment. South Africans will go to the polling stations on 8 May, to cast their vote in the national elections. Read: ANC birthday cake spelling blunder
