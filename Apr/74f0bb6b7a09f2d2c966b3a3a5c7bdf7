The Ethekwini Metro Police and National Prosecuting Authority are currently at an impasse which has led to a large number of speeding fines not being issued. The Mercury reports that the conflict – caused by a dispute over the financial model used to issue and collect money for fines – has meant that the city’s metro police have not issued a single speeding fine in the past two years. These include offences caught on static cameras, and motorists who failed to stop at red lights and drove in lanes designated for public transport vehicles, it said. Speaking to BusinessTech, Ethekwini municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela, confirmed that there is ‘currently an issue that was raised by the NPA in regard to fines’. “However, the city is looking at addressing this urgently,” he said. “This does not mean that the relevant Department has not enforced traffic law. Our officers still work diligently to ensure that our roads are safe.” “We are nearing a resolution, though we cannot say when this is likely to be resolved,” he said. Mayisela said that the issue only impacted static cameras, with no other fining affected. Read: These are the worst places for carjacking in South Africa
