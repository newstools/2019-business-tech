Jaguar’s highest performance SUV, the F-Pace SVR, is now available in South Africa. The car boasts 405kW of power, 680Nm of torque, and is capable of launching from 0-100km/h in 4.3 seconds at a top speed of 283km/h. New aerodynamic enhancements include larger air intakes at the front and side fender vents that lower pressure in the wheel arches, reduce lift and provide additional cooling while also optimising high-speed stability. At the rear, a spoiler is joined by a new bumper housing the quad tailpipes of the active exhaust system. <img class="size-full wp-image-313704 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-2-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-313706 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-313708 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Pace-4-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> New features Beyond the visual enhancements, the F-Pace SVR features a range of enhanced tech. These include the Sports-tuned Electronic Differential and adaptive dynamics, while Torque Vectoring by braking provides controlled independent braking on the individual inside front and rear wheels – maximising capability through even the tightest corners. The Dynamic Stability Control System has been adapted to suit the added performance potential of the F-Pace SVR with the system able to reduce engine torque or apply braking to individual wheels to help maintain the chosen line when cornering. Jaguar’s engineers have also developed a unique dynamic driving Mode for the SVR, which initiates faster, more responsive gearshifts, sharper throttle responses and increased steering response. <img class="size-full wp-image-313710 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Space-5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Space-5.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Space-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Space-5-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-313712 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Space-7.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Space-7.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Space-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/F-Space-7-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Inside, the SVR features a 650-litre loadspace – with rear seats up.
