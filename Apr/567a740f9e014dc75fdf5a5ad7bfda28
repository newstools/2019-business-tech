South African motorists have been hit hard in April, thanks to additional motoring related tax, and a big petrol price hike. This combined with rising vehicle prices means that it is becoming increasingly more expensive to drive in the country. South Africans are no strangers to increasing car prices, and it wasn’t too long ago that a sub-R100,000 price was a major selling point for an entry-level vehicle. However, local car-buyers would do well in buying an entry-level vehicle for less than R150,000 currently, with even popular models such as the Polo Vivo now priced at around the R200,000 mark. BusinessTech looked at nine entry-level vehicles you can still buy for less than R165,000 in South Africa, that are also light on fuel.
