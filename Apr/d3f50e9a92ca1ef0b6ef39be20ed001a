Vehicle evaluation group, True Price, has published new data showing the bakkies that have the best resale value in South Africa. The group’s data is gathered from thousands of vehicles sold on auction around the country. Darryl Jacobson, MD of True Price, said that the resale value of bakkies is of major importance as companies often operate pick-up fleets. This means that a bakkie buyer can lose tens of thousands of rands when the time comes to sell, he said. True Price found that the Toyota Hilux currently has the best resale value among South Africa’s bakkies. “Motorists believe that they are purchasing reliability and peace of mind when they opt for Toyota,” said Jacobson. “Toyota dealers have an outstanding reputation for delivering good service at fair prices. “Furthermore, the dealer network is vast, meaning that you don’t have to look long and hard to locate a dealer. Spare parts are also readily available,” Jacobson said. The Chevrolet Utility and Isuzu KB/D-Max round up the top three. “The Isuzu KB is one of the most well-known bakkie derivatives in South Africa, hence its number three ranking,'” said Jacobson. However, he said that it was surprising that Chevrolet’s bakkie ranked so highly considering General Motor’s exit from the country. “Previously badged the Corsa Utility, this benchmark sub-one ton bakkie was rebadged the Chevrolet Utility back in 2010,” he said. “It was an incredibly popular bakkie; in fact, at the time of rebadging, sales were rapidly approaching the 150 000 mark. After rebadging, its popularity did not wane. And for good reason: it is an affordable, robust and reliable workhorse.” Best resale values Below is a list of the 10 bakkies with the best resale value in South Africa right now. All vehicles in the study were first registered in the years 2015 to 2018 (both years inclusive) and they have done between 0 and 150,000 km. The percentage indicates how much of the original selling price the vehicle achieved on auction.
