Nokia phones maker HMD Global has announced the Nokia 9 PureView in South Africa, featuring what it claims is the world’s first five camera array with ZEISS Optics. “All five cameras are seamlessly integrated into the 8mm slim phone ensuring there is no camera bump,” the group said. The Nokia 9 PureView is exclusively available from Vodacom and its retail partners – in Midnight Blue from Vodacom World on a R699.00/month deal or from R11,849.00 on Prepaid. Every shot taken by the Nokia 9 PureView uses all five cameras to capture at least 60MP of imaging data. “To process and fuse the images Nokia 9 PureView has maximised the heterogenous computing architecture of the Qualcomm Snapdragon mobile platform assigning tasks across ISP, DSP, GPU and CPU. “Featuring a dedicated imaging co-processor that individually adjusts exposure and white balance on each camera across the scene, the Nokia 9 PureView gives you a glimpse into the future of smartphone photography,” HMD Global said. “On top, we bring power editing suites like Adobe Photoshop Lightroom and Google Photos depth editor right to your fingertip – now explore every detail with your Nokia 9 PureView,” said Shaun Durandt, GM of HMD Global Southern Africa, who noted that Nokia sold three times as many mobile phones in the country in 2018, as were sold the year before. The Nokia 9 PureView also features a 5.99” 2K pOLED screen with PureDisplay technology and integrated Qi Wireless charging. “The PureDisplay screen technology features HDR10 support letting you enjoy crisp details, great contrast and rich colours in supported content.” The Nokia 9 PureView screen also features an integrated fingerprint sensor, with security features further complemented by advanced biometric face unlock technology, HMD Global said. The Nokia 9 PureView launches with Android 9 Pie out of the box. “It joins the comprehensive line-up of Nokia smartphones in the Android One family, which means it delivers the latest Android innovations and software experiences. Nokia smartphones with Android One offer great storage and battery life right out of the box and come with three years of monthly security patches and two major OS updates,” the mobile firm said. Android 9 Pie includes AI-powered features, it said, to make the device smarter, faster and adapt to your behaviour as you use it. “The Adaptive Battery feature limits battery usage from apps you don’t use often, and App Actions predicts what you’re about to do so you can get to your next action quickly. These features further streamline your device’s functionality and your overall Android experience,” HMD Global said. The Nokia 9 PureView will receive three years of monthly security patches and two major OS updates, as guaranteed in the Android One program. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-309040" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nokia9-e1554375505688.png" alt="" width="1200" height="1200" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-309042" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nokia9-imag1-e1554375490974.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1200" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-309038" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nokia9-image-e1554375514176.png" alt="" width="1200" height="1200" /> Read: MTN and Vodacom contract deals: P30 Pro vs Galaxy S10+ vs Apple Xs Max
