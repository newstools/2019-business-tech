Land Rover South Africa has developed a one-of-a-kind Range Rover Sport SVR as a tribute to the Springbok rugby team. Created in a three-way partnership with Land Rover’s Special Vehicle Operations (SVO), Land Rover South Africa and the South African Rugby Union (SARU), the unique Range Rover Sport is the first and only vehicle to be completely finished in the Springboks’ very specific green hue. The exact Pantone colour match was applied to the Range Rover’s bare shell at the very start of its build process at SVO’s dedicated paint facility, while  Springbok logos and bespoke yellow brake calipers finish off the exterior’s visual enhancements. Normally reserved for Land Rover’s own trademark logos, the circular plaques on the Sport’s B-pillars and front and rear treadplates now also feature Springbok insignias and script. “We entered the process of designing this vehicle with Land Rover some months ago, and SARU is delighted to have played a part in the result,” said Jurie Roux, CEO of SA Rugby. “This project is the first of its kind for the Springboks and I’m sure there will be many excited conversations among the players who will get the opportunity to drive it,” said Jurie Roux, CEO of SA Rugby. Land Rover said that South African customers can contact any of its dealers for potential bespoke commissions to be fulfilled by Special Vehicle Operations in the UK. <img class="size-full wp-image-312704 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-312706 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-312708 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-312710 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-4-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-312712 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-5.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-5-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-312714 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-6.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-6.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Springbok-6-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: How many Mustangs Ford has sold in South Africa
