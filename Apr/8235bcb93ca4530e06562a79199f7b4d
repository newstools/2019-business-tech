The IT, business & management and finance sectors are undoubtedly the most sought after sectors, followed by the sales, admin, office & support and architecture & engineering sectors, among others listed. When looking at active job seekers across various sectors (indicated by the supply graph), areas of high supply correlate closely to areas of high demand, however supply outstrips demand in some areas, leading to a competitive environment for job seekers. In terms of fluctuating demand, the sales, manufacturing and ICT sectors have displayed volatile demand trends during the last 3 quarters. Job volumes remain lower than the previous year, CareeJunction said. Following a downturn at the outset of 2018, job volumes have grown moderately since January in the finance, marketing and construction sectors. However, jobs in construction remain significantly lower year-on-year. Hiring activity has cooled considerably in the engineering, business & management, admin, office & support and medical sectors over the last 6 months. “This is particularly evident in the medical sector. Year-on-year, job volumes are down by 14%, 18%, 24% and 47% respectively,” it said. Read: Why you should be more hopeful about South Africa’s future
