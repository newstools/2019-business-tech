South Korean firm, Songuo Motors, has announced a distribution deal which will see the company bring its affordable NeuWai vehicles to new regions – including South Africa. The first NeuWai vehicles will be introduced for sale within 12 months, the company said in a statement. The range of vehicles already announced and planned for production in 2020 include 2-seat and 4-seat ultra-compact cars, an SUV, a modular vehicle, a 1-ton truck, motorcycles and scooters. NeuWai said that its A-class and larger vehicles will be powered by AC electric motors. In addition to Euro 6 gasoline engines, NeuWai will offer both Euro 4 gasoline and liquid propane injection (LPI) combustion engines in markets where these powertrains have a compelling advantage. Songuo Motors said that it also took an innovative approach to designing and engineering these vehicles. This includes space frames, which provide a structural advantage over unnecessarily heavy frames or unibody construction, it said. “NeuWai vehicles also use proprietary composite body panels moulded in colour with a glossy exterior finish. “This allows for consistent colour without painting, solving the century-old challenge of painting body parts in an assembly plant. “The recyclable material also takes door dings out of the equation, as well as minor fender benders,” it said.
