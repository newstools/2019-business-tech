Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande, has warned that truck drivers are planning to shut down some of South Africa’s major national roads during the Easter Weekend. In a statement, Nzimande called on law enforcement agencies to arrest all those ‘intending to destabilise peace and stability’ on the country’s roads by disrupting the flow of traffic and burning public and private property. He said that by blocking national roads, truck drivers not only disrupt the traffic flow but their actions are tantamount to sabotage of the economy of the country, government service delivery programmes and disruption of the Easter break by millions of South Africans who will be on the roads during this time. “We are also calling upon the law enforcement agencies not only to arrest those responsible but also to impound all vehicles involved,” Nzimande said. “I have been assured by the security cluster that it is ready to deal decisively with any such possible disruptions. Nzimande said that his department and the Department of Labour had been in active discussions with these truck drivers and were trying to resolve their problems. He said that any planned action to block our roads is a clear indication that the truck driver’s associations are engaging government in bad faith, misleading all involved that they are committed to discussions. “It is disingenuous and disturbing that after numerous meetings which were followed by agreed recommendations between government and the Truck Driver’s Associations, that today we are informed about this unfortunate development to block our roads,” he said.
