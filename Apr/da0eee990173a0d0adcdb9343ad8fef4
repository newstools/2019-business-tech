Huawei will officially launch its flagship P30 Series of smartphones at an event in Johannesburg on Wednesday (3 April), having revealed the range internationally, at an event in Paris last week. The new phones place a great emphasis on photography. Huawei’s P30 Pro camera functionality is unrivaled, while an overhauled design minimises the presence of the front camera notch – expanding the edges of the OLED display. Major changes include the addition of in-screen optical fingerprint sensors, with the P30 Pro getting support for wireless charging. The P30 Pro also supports 40W fast wireless charging in addition to wireless quick charge and reverse wireless charging functionality. The display is almost completely bezel-less, with Huawei minimising the top and bottom bezels and removing the front speaker in favour of a sound-on display solution which vibrates the smartphone’s screen to produce audio. And, aimed at young consumers, Huawei earlier this week launched the Huawei P30 lite into the local market, equipped with three rear cameras with support for ultra-wide angle photography and artificial intelligence (AI) features. “Making high quality photography accessible, it enables young photography enthusiasts to capture professional-quality images on a smartphone. The triple-camera setup comprises a 24MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide angle camera and a depth camera,” Huawei said. “Best of all, the device has an impressive memory – 4GB RAM + 128GB ROM – that can store all of these stunning photos, along with all your apps, videos, and more,” it said.
