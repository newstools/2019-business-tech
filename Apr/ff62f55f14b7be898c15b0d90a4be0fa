Toyota has refreshed its electric hybrid, the Prius halo five-door hatch, which features new front and rear treatment, as well as sharper, sleeker headlights and rear combination lights. “Inside, the cabin incorporates design tweaks to improve ergonomics as well as changes to the interior trim whilst retaining the luxurious black leather upholstery,” it said. The Prius 1.8 is available in South Africa priced at R490,200 The updated hatch features restyled front and rear bumpers that give it a more dynamic flowing appearance that is further enhanced by its slightly longer (+35mm) overall length, Toyota said. It includes new slimline headlights with bi-beam LEDs, and a revised lower intake. “A change to LED fog lamps unify the front-light signature, Toyota said. At the rear, new combination LED lights mirror the shape of the headlights by introducing a more horizontal look to emphasise the car’s width and low centre of gravity, Toyota said. The updated model is available in two new exterior metallic paint finishes – Fierce Red and Sky Blue metallic. An additional six exterior hues are also on offer, it said. The Prius uses 15-inch aluminium wheels with a redesigned 10-spoke aerodynamic silver cover with eco-boosting Michelin tyres in 195-65-R15 sizing. “A redesign of the centre console that incorporates two cupholders, seat heating switches and a newly added wireless phone charger, further improves interior style and ergonomics. The previously employed white colour treatment of the console has been replaced by elegant Piano Black,” Toyota said. The new platform uses the latest generation petrol-electric hybrid drivetrain, combining a 1.8-litre Atkinson cycle petrol engine, with two motor generators to provide the optimum balance of performance and fuel efficiency. System output is quoted as 100kW.
Fuel consumption for the combined cycle is specified as 3.7 litres per 100 km.
CO2 emissions listed as 87 g/km. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310002" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-5.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-5-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-309998" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-3-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310012" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-dash.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-dash.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-dash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-dash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310010" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-boot.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-boot.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-boot-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-boot-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310000" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-4-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-309994" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="750" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prius-1-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: These are the cars that South African ministers and deputy ministers are driving
