Huawei has released its first-week sales figures for the Huawei P30 Pro, with the device set to become the company’s most popular smartphone in South Africa. “After just five days, sales of the Huawei P30 Pro showed a 244% increase when compared to the number of Huawei P20 Pro devices sold during its launch week in mid-2018,” it said. “Sales of the Huawei P30 show a 44% increase on the number of Huawei P20 smartphones sold during its first week of sales.” Huawei has quickly become a major player in South Africa and has launched smartphones across a multitude of pricing ranges, from the budget-oriented Y series to its premium Mate series. The company has rapidly caught up with Apple and Samsung, overtaking the former in terms of overall market share last year. Speaking to MyBroadband in February, Huawei South Africa CTO Akhram Mohamed said that the company was now setting its sights on the top position across all pricing segments in the local market. Mohamed said the strong performance of Huawei’s smartphones across the board could result in the company reaching this goal by the end of 2019 or 2020. “In 2018, Huawei was either number one or number two in every pricing segment,” Mohamed told MyBroadband. “And where we are number two, the gap is so small that we think we could break through very quickly.” Read: MTN launches new Huawei P30, P30 Lite and P30 Pro deals
