New data released by Statistics South Africa shows how much each province contributes to the country’s total GDP. Stats SA found that Gauteng generated just over a third of South Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017, making it the nation’s biggest provincial economy. KwaZulu-Natal was the second biggest, responsible for R16 of every R100 generated by the national economy, followed by the Western Cape in third. Northern Cape, the smallest provincial player, would need to multiply its economic output by 17 in order to square up against Gauteng, Stats SA said <img class=" wp-image-308328 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng.jpg" alt="" width="655" height="579" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng.jpg 997w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-300x265.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-768x679.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “Gauteng’s economic dominance is not surprising,” Stats SA said. “Finance, government, manufacturing, construction and four other industries are heavily represented in the province. “Agriculture and mining are the two exceptions. National agriculture production is mostly concentrated in Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. “The bulk of national mining activity takes place in North West, Mpumalanga and Limpopo.” Gauteng Gauteng was home to 14.3 million people in 2017, according to data from the mid-year population estimates report. The province contributed R1.59 trillion to the country’s GDP of R4.65 trillion (current prices), translating to R111,171 per person. This makes it the top ranking province in terms of GDP per capita – followed by Western Cape and Free State. The Eastern Cape was the lowest ranking province with around R55,094 per person. “Even if Eastern Cape were able to double its GDP per capita, it would still be slightly lower than that of Gauteng, ” Stats SA said. <img class=" wp-image-308330 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-2.png" alt="" width="692" height="601" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-2.png 1127w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-2-300x261.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-2-768x667.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-2-1024x890.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Know what tax bracket you fall into in South Africa
