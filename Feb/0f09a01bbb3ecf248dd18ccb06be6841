Vox has sent an email to customers announcing an increase in the price of fibre packages on Fibrehoods lines, MyBroadband reports. Vumatel recently stated that it would adjust the price of its Fibrehoods lines to bring them in line with the rest of its offerings. This resulted in ISPs being forced to either increase the price of existing packages for affected customers or downgrade their packages to lower speeds. “It is our ongoing commitment to provide you with the highest level of customer care and market leading products, therefore the requirement to align with these upward adjustment in service costs,” Vox said to customers. “Your loyalty as a customer over these years is extremely important to us and we are dedicated in continuing this customer relationship with you.” Vox added that it would not make any changes to affected users’ current services and would apply “the utmost nominal increase possible” to cover its increased costs. The tables below detail the old and new pricing for legacy Fibrehoods customers on capped and uncapped packages. Vox stated that affected users are also welcome to change their current Fibrehoods package to one of the available Vumatel packages. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298558" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vox.png" alt="" width="632" height="640" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vox.png 632w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vox-296x300.png 296w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vox-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Existing Vox Basic and Pro Uncapped – Vumatel  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298554" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vumatel.png" alt="" width="450" height="497" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vumatel.png 450w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vumatel-272x300.png 272w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 85vw, 450px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298556" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vumatel1.png" alt="" width="450" height="331" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vumatel1.png 450w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vumatel1-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 85vw, 450px" />   Read: Vumatel acquired by Remgro’s CIVH
