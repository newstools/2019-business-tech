South African startup RapidDeploy has secured $12 million (R163 million) in series A funding from GreatPoint Ventures and Samsung NEXT. RapidDeploy is a cloud-based software platform that enables public safety officials to reduce emergency response times and improve situational awareness. It was built by first responders using modern Microsoft Azure Government Cloud architecture, providing reliability, cybersecurity using state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence. According to the platform’s co-founder and CTO, Brett Meyerowitz, the financing will enable the group to expand its existing product and technology teams, and will also assist the company to further leverage cloud and mobile technologies in the interests of the first responder communities. In 2018, US telco AT&T announced that it was teaming up with RapidDeploy to provide 911 centres access to RapidDeploy’s cloud-based platform. Since then, RapidDeploy has assembled a core team of US-based public-safety industry leaders who are passionate to drive innovation and improve emergency communications, and opened its global headquarters in downtown Austin, Texas, earlier in 2019. After the AT&T deal, the company moved its headquarters from Cape Town to the USA. “Modernising the first-responder ecosystem with cloud-based dispatch technologies will enable public safety organisations to perform faster and seamlessly across jurisdictions,” said GreatPoint Ventures managing partner, and former president of Oracle, Ray Lane. Lane will join RapidDeploy’s Board of Directors. Raymond Liao, VP and Ventures Managing Director at Samsung NEXT, said that the platform was building the rapid response system of the future. “We are excited about RapidDeploy’s products and first-responder culture, which complement Samsung’s end-to-end solution to public safety including smart devices and public safety LTE infrastructure demanded by emergency service providers,” he said.
