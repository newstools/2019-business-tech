Architects dhk has given an updated glimpse into the development of Capitec’s new headquarters in Stellenbosch, showing how it is taking shape. Capitec unveiled the design of its new head office in Stellenbosch’s Technopark in September 2018. The business currently operates from multiple buildings in the same business park and has therefore decided to consolidate its offices into one building. It added that the office will be custom-designed and owned by the company – thus increasing operational efficiencies. Financial services giant Discovery Group is paying R23.3 million a month to rent its plush global headquarters in Sandton. The annual fee equates to R280 million, and is set to escalate dramatically over the following 15-year lease agreement it has with Growthpoint, who is the majority shareholder of the development, which cost R3 billion to build. Discovery will not own the building after the 15-year lease period ends, and will need to draw up a new agreement, once the current contract comes to an end. Capitec employs in excess of 13,000 people across the country. It is unclear how many are houses in Technopark. dhk, designed the building whilst taking into account Capitec’s current occupancy and planned growth. According to dhk, the group designed a single three-storey building for Capitec, which features a wide open-plan floor plate that ‘loops’ around a central triple-volume atrium. “The loop adopts a fluid curvilinear form that shifts along its length, capitalising on the property’s 360-degree views,” it said. “The floor plates are connected across the atrium by a series of feature bridges and staircases to promote interactivity between departments. The façade of the building was developed to accentuate the linear looped form with a simple ribbon of fenestration that responds to the ever-changing orientation of the building.” According to dhk, the new building is set to be complete by February 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-301426"
