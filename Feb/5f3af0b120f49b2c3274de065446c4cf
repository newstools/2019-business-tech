Construction has commenced at the much anticipated Kerzner Estate, considered one of the most exclusive estates on the Atlantic Seaboard. Kerzner, 81, is one of South Africa’s most successful businesspeople, known for building luxury hotels and resorts around the world. These include the likes Sun City, the Lost City, Sandton Sun, the Beverley Hills Hotel, and the Elangeni. Since leaving the hotel business, Kerzner revealed in a 2017 interview that he was looking to get into the residential property space, leveraging the 10 hectares of land he owned between Hout Bay and Llandudno. According to Ross Levin, director of Seeff Atlantic Seaboard and City Bowl, construction group Blackland has started on the first houses in the estate, of which the first phase is expected to be ready for hand-over by mid-2020. He added that all infrastructure and services are already in place, and the gym and security systems will be ready before the first house is handed over. According to Levin, three of the initial eight houses have sold at record prices of R30.5 million to R37 million. “As part of this benchmark development, and in keeping with Kerzner’s vision of always innovating and stretching the limits of possibility, six top architectural firms are working on the designs, the first houses being designed by ARRCC, Metropolis Architects, and Fabian Make Architects,” he said. Levin said that in addition to high demand from local buyers, there has been strong international interest with two of the properties sold to buyers from Germany and the UK. <img class="size-full wp-image-225253 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Estate-Map.jpg" alt="" width="2480" height="1437" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Estate-Map.jpg 2480w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Estate-Map-300x174.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Estate-Map-768x445.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Estate-Map-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Estate-Map-1200x695.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-297436 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-1.jpg 1920w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-297438 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-2.jpg 1920w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kerzner-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The estate The 10 hectare Kerzner Estate, is located high on Leeukoppie and offers views of Chapman’s Peak, the bay, valley and mountains.
