Jobs website, Adzuna, has released a new report looking at the cost of renting in South Africa. The report is based on a comparison of more than 140,000 online job listings and the average rental prices in cities across the country. One of the key focuses of the research is on the IT industry and how much average worker’s salary goes towards paying rent every month. Adzuna’s job listings show that the national average salary for an IT job in South Africa is approximately R516,031 per year. It found that IT employees living in Gauteng spend just 20% of their monthly wages on rent, making it one of the most affordable cities for tech employees to live and work in. In comparison, the Western Cape still is the most expensive province, with an average of 32% spent on rent every month from an IT employee’s average pay, the group said. “Although some employees are paid higher monthly salaries, they actually have a lot less to show for it since they have to deal with high costs of living and local property premiums,” said Adzuna country manager Jesse Green. “Alternative locations, like East London, offer a much more attractive deal that can help renters save money. “The extra cash they save on rental prices can be used to save up for a deposit to buy a home of their own,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-295972 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IT-salaries.png" alt="" width="526" height="419" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IT-salaries.png 526w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IT-salaries-300x239.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 85vw, 526px" /> Read: The cheapest and most expensive South African cities to rent in
