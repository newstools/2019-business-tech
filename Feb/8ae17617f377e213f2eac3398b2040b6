FNB has announced that its customers who use FNB Connect will now benefit from free data rollover and data transfer, in addition to the existing data depletion and out of bundle notifications. The development aligns with the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) requirements on data expiry and data transfer for all mobile network providers, FNB said. Customers will get an option for a free rollover of data near the expiry date for use in the following month, and can also transfer data to one another, which is a major benefit for households, the bank said. FNB said that customers will also receive depletion notifications when their data usage is at 50%, 80% and 100%, allowing them to actively track and manage usage. To promote transparency, customers are requested to provide consent before being charged out of bundle data rates and have the option to buy a new bundle. New data rules Originally scheduled to come into effect from June 2018, Icasa has confirmed that the implementation of the End-User and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations will now take place from 28 February 2019. The new regulations mean that South Africa’s mobile operators may now no longer automatically start billing subscribers out-of-bundle tariffs when their data bundles are depleted. Instead, they must present subscribers with the option to buy a new bundle, or agree to out-of-bundle billing – alongside usage depletion notifications (SMSes) as customers consume their data bundles. Icasa also proposed that users’ mobile data must roll over if they do not deplete their bundles, and that consumers can transfer data to other subscribers on the same network.
