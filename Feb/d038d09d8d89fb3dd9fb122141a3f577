Savills Tech Cities index measures 30 cities from around the world against 100 individual metrics, ranging from the volume of inward venture capital investment through to the cost of a flat white coffee, to establish which cities are the most successful homes for tech and start-up companies. The group noted that tech cities are important centres for tech in their region and VC investment hotspots. “Vibrant cities in which to live and work, they are magnets for talent,” it said. The Savills Tech Cities index measures what makes them successful. The report noted that GDP across the 30 Tech Cities is forecast to rise by 36% in the next decade, against a rate of 19% across other developed cities. New York has emerged as the premier Tech City in this year’s index, overtaking San Francisco. Cape Town ranked 30th on the list. Access to a deep talent pool and the city’s reputation as a global centre of commerce makes New York the global leader, Savills said. Chinese Tech Cities now account for a higher share of VC investment than their US counterparts. Beijing recorded an average $34 billion of VC p.a. in the last three years, volumes higher even than New York and San Francisco. The Savills Tech Cities index measures what makes a successful Tech City.  These metrics are grouped into six categories: business environment, tech environment, city buzz & wellness, talent pool, real estate costs, and mobility. Each category is weighted to reflect its importance to the tech sector. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298186" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/figure-1-new.png" alt="" width="721" height="1260" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/figure-1-new.png 721w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/figure-1-new-172x300.png 172w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/figure-1-new-586x1024.png 586w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: US workspace provider WeWork is launching in Joburg
