Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande, has approved the adjustment of toll tariffs on national roads for 2019, Gazetted on Friday (1 February), the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) said that the adjustments were made in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and VAT increase, and will come into effect on 1 March 2019. Notably, the gazette includes adjustments to tolls that form part of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project and the controversial e-toll system. The Gauteng and national government has continued to flip-flop on the future of e-tolls with no clarity on whether or not the tolling system will be scrapped. In an interview with Independent Media in December, Makhura said that e-tolling has no future in Gauteng, and that he has president Cyril Ramaphosa’s ear on the matter. “I am engaged in discussions with president Cyril Ramaphosa to scrap the e-tolls. I made a persuasive call to him,” he said. “He understands that these e-tolls are burdensome to the working class owning cars and middle class.” You can find a full breakdown of the new toll tariffs below.
