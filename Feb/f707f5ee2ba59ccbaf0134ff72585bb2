Elite Traveler has recently named its top 100 hotels in the world for 2019. The Elite Traveler magazine is aimed at ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals and is the only audited publication with worldwide distribution aboard private jets, first-class lounges and in fixed-base operations across over 100 countries. The top 100 hotels list was curated by the magazine’s team of experts and features more than 34 countries. Some of the factors considered when selecting a hotel include the resorts that go above and beyond to offer the most captivating atmosphere, extraordinary comfort, impeccable service and standout amenities. While the majority of the luxury hotels are located across the US and Europe, two South African hotels feature on the list – La Residence in Franschhoek and Singita Ebony Lodge in Sabi Sand. Singita Ebony Lodge Top suite cost: Ebony Family Suite from $5,525 (R76,667) per night Elite Traveler noted that Singita celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2018, with the camp winning a number of awards since its opening. “Ebony Lodge is our favourite camp and is perfect for a family safari vacation,” it said. “Situated in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve and surrounded by ebony trees, the lodge has 12 gorgeous suites with private pools and open fireplaces. “Each suite also has its own deck suspended above the riverbank that overlooks the bushveld — don’t be surprised if you spot animals drinking from the river.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294504 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-1-1024x489.png" alt="" width="840" height="401" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-1-1024x489.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-1-300x143.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-1-768x367.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-1-1200x573.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294506 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-2-1024x486.png" alt="" width="840" height="399" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-2-1024x486.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-2-300x142.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-2-768x364.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-2-1200x569.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294508 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-3-1024x501.png" alt="" width="840" height="411" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-3-1024x501.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-3-300x147.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-3-768x376.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-3-1200x588.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294510 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-4-1024x492.png" alt="" width="840" height="404" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-4-1024x492.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-4-300x144.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-4-768x369.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-4-1200x576.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294512 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-5-1024x502.png" alt="" width="840" height="412" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-5-1024x502.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-5-300x147.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-5-768x376.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Singita-5-1200x588.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> La Residence Top suite cost: Three-bedroom Vineyard Suite from $1,750 (R24,283) per night. Elite Traveler noted that La Residence stands out for its location beneath the foothills of the Franschhoek Mountains, surrounded by  a 30-acre estate brimming with vines, fruit trees, flowers and herbs. “It is flamboyantly decadent and one of a kind, especially for South Africa, where most hotels are a little more austere,” the magazine said. “An eclectic mix of inspirations, from a Maharaja’s palace to the Palace of Versailles, means that no two guestrooms are the same, and there’s fine art and antiques wherever you look. “The panoramic views from the swimming pool are to die for, and if you want to head out and explore, there’s a complimentary vehicle on call to whisk you around — or hop on a bicycle to take it all in.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294514 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-1-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-1-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-1-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-1.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294516 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-2-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-2-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-2-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-2.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="wp-image-294518 size-large aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-3-1024x606.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="497" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-3-1024x606.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-3-300x178.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-3-768x454.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-3.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294520 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-4-1024x659.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="541" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-4-1024x659.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-4-300x193.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-4-768x494.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-4.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-294522 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-5-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/La-Residence-5.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />  Read: Oxfam wants governments to hike tax rates for the world’s richest people
