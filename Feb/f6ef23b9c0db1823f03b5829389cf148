In its investor presentation, TymeBank compares its fee structure to those of the established banks in the country, based on a medium-use banking profile of 17 transactions a month. The fee comparison is based on Solidarity’s 2018 banking charges report. It’s worth noting that in the comparison below, withdrawal transactions are split between POS withdrawals and own-ATM withdrawals. According to TymeBank, even though it does not have its own ATMs, because of its partnership with Pick n Pay and Boxer stores, each till-point effectively becomes an access point to withdraw and deposit money. Withdrawals at these till points is free. If withdrawals are made at other retailers, this fee is R2.00 – and if customers head to an ATM, a withdrawal carries a charge of R8.00 per R1,000. Because the Solidarity report was published in September 2018, it does not include Bidvest Bank’s GROW account (which launched in November 2018), nor does it cover Capitec’s fee changes announced this month. We have updated the information to include these changes, for the most recent like-for-like comparison. These are outlined below: The 17 transaction profile includes POS withdrawals, limited ATM withdrawals, prepaid purchases, internet payments (EFTs) and debit orders. TymeBank does not currently have prepaid airtime purchases available, but the bank did indicate that it is in the works, and that it won’t charge for these transactions. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-301994" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SA-Entry-Bank-Accounts-2.png" alt="" width="833" height="713" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SA-Entry-Bank-Accounts-2.png 833w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SA-Entry-Bank-Accounts-2-300x257.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SA-Entry-Bank-Accounts-2-768x657.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />  Fee structures A breakdown of the SA bank entry level account fee structures can be found below: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-301986" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TymeBank-Banner.png" alt="" width="640" height="100" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TymeBank-Banner.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TymeBank-Banner-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> You can view the TymeBank Fees here. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289906" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Old-Mutual-Banner.png" alt="" width="640" height="100" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Old-Mutual-Banner.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Old-Mutual-Banner-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> You can view the Old Mutual Money Account fee schedule for 2018/19 here. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289908" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Capitec-Banner.png" alt="" width="640" height="100" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Capitec-Banner.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Capitec-Banner-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
