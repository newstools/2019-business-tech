[702] President Ramaphosa has announced that the national elections will take place on 8 May 2019. This does not count as the official proclamation of the date, and unregistered voters still have until then to head to the IEC offices to register. [TimesLive] South Africa is expected to get a new version of ‘the Scorpions’ – an elite investigative unit with the power to root out corruption at the highest levels. While details are scant, president Ramaphosa did indicate that a new specialised unit would be created to this effect, to help the new head of the NPA. [City Press] An NGO is trying to stop Multichoice’s listing on the JSE, having formally complained to Icasa saying that the media group needs to get Icasa approval and open up to public comment to do so. Multichoice says Icasa approval is not necessary. The group plans to list on 27 February.
