As part of its annual budget, the National Treasury has published the proposed salaries for the president in 2019/2020 – subject to final parliamentary approval. With the national elections set to take place in May this year, it also included the projected salaries that Cyril Ramaphosa can expect to earn (should he remain as president) for the 2020/21 and 2021/22 financial years. For the coming financial year, president Ramaphosa has been apportioned a salary of R3.9 million. This number is projected to rise to R4.2 million for the 2020/21 and R4.5 million 2021/22 financial years. Treasury also published the proposed salaries for the Deputy President. As is the case for other South African executive positions, the deputy president, David Mabuza, can expect to earn slightly less than Ramaphosa at R3.3 million this year. This number is projected to rise to an annual salary of R3.6 million in 2020/21 and R3.8 million in 2021/2022. <img class="size-full wp-image-300868 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Salary-Ramaphosa-2019.png" alt="" width="1008" height="418" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Salary-Ramaphosa-2019.png 1008w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Salary-Ramaphosa-2019-300x124.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Salary-Ramaphosa-2019-768x318.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> As is the case with much of the budget, these salaries are subject to final parliamentary approval and do not represent the figures that Ramaphosa or Mabuza may actually take home. In 2018, Ramaphosa donated half of his R3.6 million salary to the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The president is reported to have a net worth of $450 million (R6.2 billion), having previously-held notable ownership in companies such as McDonald’s South Africa. Cabinet costs While this presidential salary would make Ramaphosa one of the best paid presidents in the world, the government has also come under scrutiny for its bloated cabinet. During his budget speech, finance minister Tito Mboweni said that MPs will lead by example and not get salary increases in the current fiscal year. A recent report by the Sunday Times indicated that Ramaphosa intends to drastically reduce his cabinet from 72 to 40 members. A source close to the presidency said that deputy ministers will likely be the hardest hit, with Ramaphosa reportedly having decided that there should be no deputy ministers in non-essential departments. South Africa’s cabinet ballooned from around 50 members under Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki, to 72 members under Zuma. A 2018 report by the Democratic Alliance found that this increase meant that South Africa’s 35 ministers and 37 deputy ministers would earn R163.5 million and over R510.5 million over the medium-term. In addition to salaries, the DA said that the current cabinet had overspent on housing and vehicles. Read: What South Africa lost in the “9 wasted years” under Zuma
