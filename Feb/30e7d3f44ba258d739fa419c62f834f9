Unions refuse to accept the prospect of any job losses. [ENCA] Due to the shortage of generating capacity, Eskom will continue to implement stage 3 load shedding today from 08h00 until 23h00. The power utility said it will try to end rotational blackouts by the end of the week. [Eskom] Public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan says that external experts will have to be brought in to help manage the Eskom crisis. Gordhan detailed several crisis-level issues at Eskom, including how costs have increased by seven times. [Mail & Guardian] Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor has ended her state capture testimony in a far weaker position, after being grilled on her account of events – from almost a decade ago – which appeared to be full of holes and unsubstantiated claims. Mentor at times contradicted and refuted evidence at hand. [Daily Maverick] The rand firmed on Tuesday, supported by rising risk appetite globally and recovering from a sharp selloff in the previous session when it was hit by a sudden escalation of controlled power cuts in South Africa. On Wednesday the rand was at R13.72 to the dollar, R17.70 to the pound and R15.55 to the euro.
