Former finance minister Trevor Manuel says that in the last decade Eskom has had 12 chief executive officers, six chairpersons, 60 directors, and 30 executives, which cost the state company a whopping R514 million. Manuel was testifying before the Zondo commission into state capture on Thursday, the morning after Eskom again warned of possible load-shedding due to poor performing power units. He added that the collapse of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the last decade reflected the fact that the powers given to state companies were exercised without care and attention to detail. He said that reckless spending denied the poor basic access to services. Eskom in its history was an extremely strong institution, one of the top utilities in the world, the former minister said. “Eskom had a stronger credit rating than we had as a sovereign, and we would look to Eskom with a sense of jealousy about the fact that they could borrow more cheaply.” Manuel pointed out that the state company, which accounts for 95% of the country’s power, had surplus capacity to a point where its power stations were mothballed. He said that if you look at what has happened over the past decade, “all of that has come apart”. He said that Eskom previously never imposed a burden on the fiscus. “If you look at the position of Eskom now … it is clear that Eskom sits as an albatross around the neck of the fiscus,” he told the commission. Manuel warned that the risk of losing its investment grade rating, means that South Africa will need to borrow at much higher costs. He also pointed to a cavalier attitude by management over the past decade. “If decisions are taken with a focus of ‘short-terminism’ for the benefit of private individuals, then I think the costs are born by all of society.”
