Finance minister Tito Mboweni will be delivering his first full budget speech today in Parliament. The speech will begin at 14h00, with build up starting about 30 minutes before, at 13h30. In addition to delivering the 2019 Budget Speech, Mboweni will also table the Division of Revenue Bill and introduce the Appropriation Bill and the Public Audit Excess Fee Bill. Mboweni faces an uphill battle to balance the interests of the South African economy, and the government’s political goals – particularly in this, an election year. Analysts expect the minister to be light on taxes, with a stronger focus on building on the revenue collection mechanisms already in place. However, some tax changes – particularly around fuel levies and wealth taxes – may be on the cards. The minister will also need to address the growing government wage bill, the economic stimulus plans, and the country’s budget deficit. The big thing that everyone will be looking out for is word on government’s plans with Eskom, which is facing a liquidity crisis that could tank the economy. In his state of the nation address, president Cyril Ramaphosa said that government has already committed to bailing Eskom out, but gave no indication as to the form or the quantum of said bailout. Eskom will also be facing structural changes, with the plan to split the group into three companies, which will also have associated costs. Other things to look out for include bailouts for other SOEs; budgetary plans for free education; and the implementation of National Health Insurance, which is also said to be close to finalisation. The budget is an ordinary part of Parliament’s process, and will be live-streamed through Parliament TV and several other news sources.
