King Goodwill Zwelithini is set to launch a new mobile network in South Africa – Bayede Mobile – in mid-2019. Bayede Mobile was born from a strategic partnership forged between King Goodwill Zwelithini, the founders of JR Capital, “and a well-established Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) with both local and international expertise”. The vision behind this new mobile network is to provide the people of South Africa with mobile access at affordable rates, enabling communities to easily connect, a statement from the new entity said. Bayede Mobile has the backing of the private sector and government, and “will help reach those with little to no access to basic mobile infrastructure at an excellent rate”. King Goodwill Zwelithini also called for strategic partnerships with various faith-based organisations, tribal leaders and other institutions. “Bayede Mobile has been a vision of ours for many years. To see this mobile network come to fruition, through an alliance with King Goodwill Zwelithini and government, creates the foundation for a successful brand that will give mobile communication access to people and communities who need it most,” JR Capital said. “Initially, Bayede Mobile will be strategically positioned to leverage existing infrastructure of some of South Africa’s biggest mobile networks, thereby bringing reliable connectivity, at an affordable flat rate,” it said. Bayede is a Zulu salutation that translates to “hail the king”, and is already used in brands that have received the King Zwelithini’s seal of approval – such as Bayede! Wines. According to a consultant who is working on the launch of the new MVNO, the network is expected to have a wide reach. There are currently approximately 12 million subjects in the Zulu Kingdom. Further details regarding the official launch of Bayede Mobile will be revealed in due course. Read: Mr Price Mobile is coining it
