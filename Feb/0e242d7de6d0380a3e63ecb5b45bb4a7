Tech billionaire Elon Musk has reportedly listed his 280 square metre LA smart home for sale – at $4.5 million (R61 million). The tech-heavy home is located just outside Los Angeles, California, and features of a host of smart-tech features, New York Post reported. This includes security, lighting, sound and other automated devices all being controlled remotely via mobile. The listing of the property describes the 4 bedroom, 4 bathroom home as “sleek and stylish, boasting stunning ocean, city and canyon views”. It features floor-to-ceiling windows and sliders, a private back yard with a large saltwater pool and  spa. Additional features include a state-of-the art cook’s kitchen with Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances, integrated security and audio system, automated shades, top-end materials and finishes, and walk-in closets. Musk has been described as an eccentric billionaire, and a “real life Tony Stark”, with ambitious and futuristic projects like the Hyperloop emerging outside his tech-heavy businesses like Tesla electric vehicles and his hand in space through SpaceX. Musk was born in South Africa and moved to the United States after completing his matric at Pretoria Boys High School. He earned his billions as a co-founder of Paypal, before moving onto Tesla and SpaceX.
