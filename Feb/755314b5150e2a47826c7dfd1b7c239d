The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers (Naamsa) has released its vehicle statistics for January 2019. The data shows that new vehicle sales stumbled into 2019 with industry sales down 7.4% to 42,374 units year-on-year. Passenger vehicles sales declined 10.8%, while Light Commercial Vehicle sales remained flat with 0% growth compared to January last year. “This doesn’t come as a surprise given WesBank’s outlook for the new vehicle marketing during 2019,” said Wesbank’s Ghana Msibi. “We expect the first half to be slow given the increased pressure on household budgets as interest rates slowly increase and, especially, the political uncertainty towards the May elections.” One area that could still impress in 2019 is the SUV segment, with a number of players expected to launch new models in 2019. The 2019 fifth-generation Toyota RAV4 is set to launch in South Africa in March. Audi is also expected to launch its Q8 towards the middle of the year, while Volkswagen has confirmed that it will launch its new T-Cross before the end of the year. Below BusinessTech looked at the current competition, based on Naamsa’s data on the best-selling SUVs in South Africa right now.
