Traffic circles are used to avoid confusion at a busy intersection and they allow traffic to flow faster. Once you know and understand traffic circle rules, you’ll make your way around them with ease, says motoring management company, MotorHappy. Easy steps to navigate a traffic circle/roundabout: Firstly, you should slow down as your approach the traffic circle. If a car is already in the traffic circle, they have right of way and you should yield until you have a safe gap to enter the traffic circle. After you have entered the traffic circle, indicate if you are exciting left or right (9 o’clock or 3 o’clock) once you have reached your desired exit. If you are not turning and want to carry on straight, stay left of the circle so that other drivers who are turning right can stay closest to the side of the circle. This only applies to traffic circles with more than one lane. (You do not have to indicate if you are traveling straight, such as going from 6 o’clock to 12 o’clock). Remember that if you accidentally miss your exit, you are allowed to go around the traffic circle again but you should stay to the left of the circle, if the traffic circle has more than one lane. If the traffic circle has pedestrian crossings, keep a look out for people crossing the road before you enter the roundabout. Always stay in your lane when going around the traffic circle and you should never attempt to overtake a large vehicle or truck in the roundabout because the larger vehicle may have a larger turning radius (again this only applies to traffic circles with more than lane). <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-301332" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TrafficCircle-e1550821561622.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1200" /> Read: Major traffic warning – Johannesburg is closing down the M2 highway for repairs
