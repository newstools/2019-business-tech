Blue Label Telecoms said in a trading statement for the six months ended November 2018, that it expects to make a substantial loss, compared to the prior year. The technology group, which is the majority shareholder of Cell C, said that it expects headline earnings per share to amount to a loss of 18.78 cents per share, from prior earnings of 166.68 cents per share. Earnings per share is expected to show a loss of up to 15.74 cents per share, from prior earnings of 167.43 cents per share. Core headline earnings per share, Blue Label said, is expected to show a loss of up to  14.23 cents per share, from earnings of 168.42 cents in 2017. “Although the core businesses of the Blue Label group generated positive growth, the once-off underlying financial adjustments relating to Cell C had a negative impact thereon,” it said. “The financial results for the comparative six-month period ended 30 November 2017 included the recognition of a deferred tax asset by Cell C, of which the group’s share equated to R864 million. This was a once- off recognition to earnings in the comparative period,” Blue Label said. Blue Label said it expects to publish its results on Thursday, 28 February 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-301446" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BlueLabel.png" alt="" width="691" height="448" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BlueLabel.png 691w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BlueLabel-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: ‘Reclusive billionaire’ buying a stake in Cell C
