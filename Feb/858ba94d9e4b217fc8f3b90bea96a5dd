Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: President Cyril Ramaphosa says that splitting Eskom is the best plan of action that is on the table right now – and that this does not mean retrenchments or privatisation. He said that workers would be offered voluntary packages. He also criticised unions for choosing conflict over resolution on the matter. [TimesLive] Eskom is making good on its promise to stop load shedding by the end of the week, saying that there are no plans to implement rolling blackouts on Friday – though the risk is still low. Load shedding could be back if there is a sudden drop in generating capacity or unplanned breakdowns. [Eskom] The Hawks’ move to arrest former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi is already affecting the fight against corruption in other ongoing inquiries. Agrizzi’s legal team has said he is pulling out of testifying against those he implicated in bribery so as not to further incriminate himself. [IOL] The arrest warrant for Ajay Gupta, on charges of corruption, has been cancelled, meaning the Gupta brother, who has been placed at the centre of the state capture saga, is no longer a fugitive. The withdrawal is a consequence of the NPA’s case against those implicated in state capture falling apart due to lack of evidence. Investigations are continuing, however. [News24] South Africa’s rand weakened past R14 per dollar on Thursday as Eskom imposed a fifth day of electricity blackouts that have discouraged investors over the economy, days before the annual budget. On Friday the rand was at R14.15 to the dollar, R18.10 to the pound and R15.97 to the euro.
