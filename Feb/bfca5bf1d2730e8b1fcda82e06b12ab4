The Department of Labour (DOL) has announced that its information and communications technology and related services will be offline from 21-24 February. The DOL said that the move will have an impact on its operations and service delivery at all of its labour centres nationally. All systems will be shut down from 16:00 on the 20 February to prepare for the relocation. This means that no business systems including Umehluko, Siyaya and ESSA will be available, it said in a statement. “The Department has signed a contract with the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) to house the new datacentre in a state of the art facility in Midrand.” “The ICT Unit has already commenced with refreshing the outdated server and storage infrastructure, with further hardware refresh planned for after the relocation,” it said. Once the planned relocation is completed, it is envisaged that all systems will be available from 25 February 2019. The Department said that it hopes that the relocation of the datacentre, will bring about improved efficiencies through new infrastructure, faster connectivity, improved uptime, reliability and stability of systems. Other benefits include enhanced physical security, audit compliance and additional redundancies including reliable facilities and backup power.
