Huawei announced a range of new Matebook laptops at its Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona on Sunday (24 January). These included an updated MateBook 13 and the new MateBook 14. However, the standout new device is the updated MateBook X Pro which is equipped with a 13.9-inch, 3K Ultra (3,000 x 2,000) FullView display with 91% screen-to-body ratio and 10-point multi-touch. This touchscreen ties in with the MateBook X Pro’s new Share 3.0 ‘OneHop’ feature which allows users to transfer images, videos and documents between their laptop and smartphones instantaneously. By shaking the phone and tapping the share button on the computer, a screen recording of the notebook will be sent to the smartphone. Huawei has also developed a proprietary clipboard sharing feature, which lets users share copied content from one device and paste it on another nearby device, sharing one synchronised clipboard. Internally, the Huawei MateBook X Pro is powered by up to an 8th Generation Intel Core i7 8565U processor and an Nvidia MX250 GPU with 2GB GDDR5. Available in Mystic Silver and Space Grey the device boasts enhanced WiFi capabilities, Bluetooth 5.0, a Thunderbolt 3 port and a Dolby Atmos sound system. Huawei has also combined the power button and a finger sensor so that your device is automatically protected when powering on and off. <img class="size-full wp-image-301614 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Laptop-1.png" alt="" width="1328" height="731" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Laptop-1.png 1328w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Laptop-1-300x165.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Laptop-1-768x423.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Laptop-1-1024x564.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Laptop-1-1200x661.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-301616 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/One-hop.png" alt="" width="1323" height="729" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/One-hop.png 1323w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/One-hop-300x165.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/One-hop-768x423.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/One-hop-1024x564.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/One-hop-1200x661.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Huawei to launch a data centre in South Africa in March
