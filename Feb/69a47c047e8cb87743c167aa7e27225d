The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has signed a license agreement with streaming video service Viu. Through the partnership, Viu will gain exclusive digital rights to selected SABC titles as well as a slate of premium library content for a period of 24 months, the companies said in a joint statement. The license agreement will see a number of SABC programmes move from YouTube to Viu, while Viu has also secured Video On Demand (VOD) rights for 18 South African shows. Set to launch in South Africa at the end of February, Viu is a streaming service operating in 16 markets in countries around the world. The premium app, which offers a hybrid of both free and paid-for content has over 20-million monthly active users, 1.2-billion video views in 2018 H1 and boasts 70-plus Viu Original titles as of the end of 2018. The service can be accessed on connected devices (mobile, tablet and laptop), through the mobile app, which is available for free download on IOS and the Google Play store, and on the web at www.viu.com. The Viu app boasts the ability to download content to watch offline later, as well as a data-friendly feature allowing you to select your preferred resolution. “With its experience in delivering and successfully monetising OTT and VOD services across the globe, Viu SA will assist the SABC’s mandate of ensuring universal access for South Africa’s rich home-grown content,” said Madoda Mxakwe, SABC’s Group CEO. “This strongly aligns with our strategic objective to identify new revenue streams and, in this particular case, increasing revenue through sub-licensing SABC’s owned Intellectual Property (IP), specifically in the video entertainment space.” Read: Showmax subscribers vs Netflix in South Africa
