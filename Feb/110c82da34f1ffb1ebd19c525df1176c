Pick n Pay is trialling a new affordable reusable alternative to plastic carrier bags. The retailer said that the new bag is the first of its kind, being made from green recycled plastic bottles. It added that the bag will cost R5 and will initially be introduced in 22 stores across the country to gauge customer reaction. “Recently we’ve trialled new alternatives, such as paper bags and cardboard boxes,” said Suzanne Ackerman-Berman, director of transformation at Pick n Pay. “But the reality is that for the time being, the plastic carrier bag remains the most economical bag option for customers – despite the growing options available.” She added that the new R5 reusable bag could be a viable reusable bag option for many more customers, across all income groups. <img class="size-full wp-image-299260 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Pick-n-Pay-bag.jpg" alt="" width="5184" height="3688" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Pick-n-Pay-bag.jpg 5184w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Pick-n-Pay-bag-300x213.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Pick-n-Pay-bag-768x546.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Pick-n-Pay-bag-1024x728.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Pick-n-Pay-bag-1200x854.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Pick n Pay has also started a trial with a reusable netted fruit and vegetable fresh produce bag (R7.50) in a further effort to discourage unnecessary plastic bag usage, she said. Launched in five stores across the Western Cape at the end of December, overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers will see the retailer expand the trial to include more stores across the region, Durban North Hypermarket and five stores in Namibia by mid-February. Customers can now also bring their own transparent and sealable reusable bag in-store for loose selling produce, said Ackerman-Berman.
