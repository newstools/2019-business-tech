Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: Eskom will implement Stage 3 load shedding today from 08h00 to 22h00. While generating capacity has returned to planned levels, the group said that emergency diesel reserves are low. [Eskom] Eskom has held late night emergency meetings over its lack of power capacity – thanks in part to the failure of the Medupi and Kusile power stations to provide reliable power to the group’s generating capacity. [TimesLive] Woolworths has again been accused of stealing ideas and ripping off local products with very similar product offerings. After the Frankie’s soft drinks and the uBaba baby carrier, the makers of Superlatte and a chickpea and lentil pasta are accusing Woolies of the same. [702] Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor’s testimony before the Zondo state capture commission has been thrown into doubt, after her account of travel times and days does not match up with records. She also failed to identify the correct people she said she encountered. [Mail & Guardian] South Africa’s rand fell to its weakest in almost three weeks on Monday as state electricity firm Eskom stepped up controlled power cuts because of a shortage of generating capacity. On Tuesday the rand was at R13.79 to the dollar, R17.73 to the pound and R15.55 to the euro.
