The franchising industry has grown from contributing 13.3% to the South African Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2017 to its current figure of 15.7% despite the tough economic climate and its impact on franchises. This is according to new data published by the Franchise Association of South Africa (FASA) which expects the sector to continue growing as new technology is introduced into the market. “While the buzz, as we start a new year is with AI and robotics and how these developments may impact on business in the future, some say it has been happening for years and is nothing new,” said Vera Valasis, executive director of FASA. “These developments will have a direct correlation to manpower deployment and scheduling in business as well as stock management, site location, marketing and many other areas of business,” she said. She added that the rise in delivery has had a notable impact on the food franchises in the country. “Many franchise sectors, in particular in the food sector, are doing brisk online-and-delivery business and a change in strategy in respect of site location is around the corner,” she said. This may mean that brands place their distribution network in off-beat site locations or in low traffic areas where the lease and rental profiles are vastly different from a shopping centre location, she said. “With the unprecedented surge in the delivery of everything from food to retail sales via online sales and apps, it makes perfect business sense and I would guess this will be a fast developing trend.” With these changes in mind, BusinessTech looked at the costs of opening some of the most popular fast food franchises in South Africa.

If assistance is needed with the balance that is financed, we will provide a business profile, which is a requirement of the bank,” it said. McDonald’s <img class="aligncenter wp-image-137393" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mcdonalds-e1474372072146.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="468" /> According to McDonald’s South Africa, the official cost of a franchise varies and actual costs are only determined when an individual franchise is offered to an applicant. “The size of the restaurant, location, pre-opening expenses, inventory, selection of equipment, signage, seating and style of decor and landscaping will affect cost,” it said. “The estimated cost can be somewhere from R4 million – R6 million, depending on the type of restaurant and other factors.” McDonald’s also states that an applicant must have a minimum of 35% of the purchase price of a Restaurant in unencumbered, non-borrowed cash. “Institutional finance through e.g. banks can be used to fund the balance (McDonald’s does not provide financing or loan guarantees nor does it permit any form of borrowing from any third parties for purposes of financing the franchisee’s initial 35% contribution),” it said. Partnerships of any kind and absentee investors are not allowed.
