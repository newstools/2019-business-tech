Douglas Craigie Stevenson has been appointed as the acting Cell C chief executive officer. Stevenson has served as Cell C chief operating officer from October 2017. He has previously held positions as CEO of Telekom Networks Malawi and MD of the Vodacom Business Africa Group. Last Friday (22 February) Cell C announced that longtime CEO Jose Dos Santos would step down from the role effective 1 March 2019. In a statement, the company confirmed that Dos Santos will take up a role as a consultant offering strategic advice to the chairman of the Cell C board. The appointment of Stevenson comes at a difficult time for the company, with Cell C reporting significant losses for the year ended 31 December 2018 as part of Blue Label’s results presentation. Blue Label bought a 45% shareholding in Cell C through a subsidiary in August 2017, and has subsequently provided the network’s financial performance as part of its results presentations. Cell C recorded revenue of R15.69 billion in 2018, but suffered a total comprehensive loss of R1.27 billion. Operating profit before finance costs and tax stood at R1.43 billion, but finance costs of R4.33 billion pulled the company’s figures down. Read: ‘Reclusive billionaire’ buying a stake in Cell C
