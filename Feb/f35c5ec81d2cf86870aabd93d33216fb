For the first time in 15 years, Toyota has revealed a new-generation Quantum van and bus range with advanced safety features, powerful new engines, enhanced ride comfort and increased specification. Toyota’s Quantum model is a staple and iconic taxi brand in South Africa, with the group’s Ses’fikile model being recognisable on the roads in every almost city in the country. According to Toyota, in the minibus/panel van market the Quantum enjoys a position of market leadership with close to a thousand sales a month on average – the majority of those in the dedicated Ses’fikile taxi specification. The new generation will feature a shift to a semi-bonneted design, creating a stiffer frame, stronger straight-line performance, greater stability and manoeuvrability, and more pliant suspensions, Toyota said. The Quantum arrives in South Africa in Q2, and will be available with three-seat vans in long (LWB) and super-long wheelbase (SLWB) configurations and six-seat LWB crew cabs. The bus range will comprise of 11 (LWB) and 14-seater (SLWB) versions. The sixth-generation Quantum range will be offered with a solitary engine on the domestic front – a 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbocharged diesel. This will be combined with a 6-speed manual transmission to promote excellent tractability and fuel efficiency. Cargo capacity has been maintained at a maximum of 6.2 (LWB) and 9.3 cubic metres (SLWB) – due to longer wheelbases and packaging that increases internal width by 215mm, and height by 5mm without altering overall exterior width. LED lighting, console boxes, flip-up seats and netted seat-back pockets help create comfort whilst up to 16 cup/bottle holders are provided. The bottom edge of the front door is lower and comes with a wider step for easier access, Toyota said. Larger front-door glass and a lower belt line improve visibility, it said. Towing capacity has been expanded to a maximum 2000kg on key variants, an improvement of up to 600kg. “Newly developed MacPherson struts at the front provide excellent handling and stability, as well as ride comfort. In the rear, the new leaf spring suspension span has been increased by 200 mm, extending the bound stroke by an impressive 30 mm for a comfortable ride while enhancing handling and stability,” the Japanese carmaker said. Full model line-up, specification and pricing will be released closer to launch timing. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300280" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="707" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum-300x212.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum-768x543.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300282" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="707" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum1-300x212.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum1-768x543.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300284" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="466" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum2-300x140.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ToyotaQuantum2-768x358.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300310" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Toyota.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Toyota.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Toyota-300x180.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Toyota-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The old model Ses’fikile specification <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300300" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sesfikile-Front.jpg" alt="" width="941" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sesfikile-Front.jpg 941w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sesfikile-Front-300x159.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sesfikile-Front-768x408.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300302" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sesfikile-back.jpg" alt="" width="941" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sesfikile-back.jpg 941w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sesfikile-back-300x159.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sesfikile-back-768x408.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: These are the most reliable car brands for 2019
