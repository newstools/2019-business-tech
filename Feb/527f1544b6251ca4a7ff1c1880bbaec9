Capitec has announced its new fees for 2019, bringing price cuts almost across the board as it positions itself in a new digital banking age – and to compete with several new entry-level accounts. While banks offer different value propositions, one of the main criteria consumers look at when it comes to choosing who to bank with, is cost. Capitec’s rapid growth over the past decade, and more has been driven primarily through its simplified approach to banking – offering one account with fixed fees – which undercut the pricey and often complicated pricing structures of its competitors. The bank’s approach forced the likes of Absa, FNB, Standard Bank and Nedbank to respond with entry-level accounts of their own – a market segment that had long been neglected in favour of the more lucrative middle-market ‘gold’ accounts. More banks have entered into Capitec’s space of late, with Old Mutual launching its Money Account, and Bidvest Bank moving into transactional banking with its GROW Account. African Bank, meanwhile, has announced that it will launch its re-entry into transactional banking with its MyWORLD account set for the first half of 2019. BusinessTech looks at the basic fee structures of all the entry-level bank accounts, and how they compare to Capitec’s new fees for 2019. The banks are ordered from lowest monthly fee, to highest. Capitec’s new fees kick in from 1 March 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289906" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Old-Mutual-Banner.png" alt="" width="640" height="100" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Old-Mutual-Banner.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Old-Mutual-Banner-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> You can view the Old Mutual Money Account fee schedule for 2018/19 here. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289908" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Capitec-Banner.png" alt="" width="640" height="100" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Capitec-Banner.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Capitec-Banner-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
