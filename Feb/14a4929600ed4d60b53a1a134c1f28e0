Property development group Atterbury says construction will soon start on the new Barlow Park redevelopment in Sandton, which will cost over R3 billion to build over the next six to eight years. Located on 180 Katherine Street in Sandton, the Barlow Park Precinct is a mixed-use development that will be anchored by Barloworld, and will house the group’s new corporate HQ. It is being developed through a three-way partnership between Barloworld, Atterbury and African Rainbow Capital, with each group holding one-third of the landmark site. The total development covers 130,000 square metres, split between retail and leisure (10,000 sqm), dealerships (10,000s sqm), residential (55,000 sqm), and offices (55,000 sqm). When the development was first introduced at the end of 2017, it was said that it would ultimately hold over 780 residential units, a community retail centre, as well as a hotel and a gym. The build is expected to roll out in phases over a six- to eight-year period. According to Atterbury, the project will commence in the second quarter of 2019 starting with two months of demolition work before the bulk earthworks begin for the basements. “This will take roughly six-months to complete, then top structure construction work will begin towards the end of the year,” the group said. The site will benefit from Sandton’s new road upgrades – for private and public transport vehicles as well as cyclists and pedestrians – directly around the property. Also, being located at a major connection point to the nearby Alexandra township, the development is ideally placed to have a positive impact on its immediate community through local economic and job opportunities, during construction and for years to come after its completion, the group said. The roll-out of the Barlow Park development will respond to tenant and market demand, with the entire project expected to take six to eight years to develop. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-275381" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Barlow-Location.png" alt="" width="1353" height="820" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Barlow-Location.png 1353w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Barlow-Location-300x182.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Barlow-Location-768x465.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Barlow-Location-1024x621.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Barlow-Location-1200x727.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />
