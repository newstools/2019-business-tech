South African finance minister Tito Mboweni unveiled his budget for the coming fiscal year, and the outlook for the continent’s most industrialised economy isn’t pretty. The National Treasury has cut economic growth forecasts, plans to reduce state spending and won’t provide tax relief for citizens as it seeks more funds to prop up debt-laden state-owned companies, including yet another record bailout for power utility Eskom, which last week struggled to keep the lights on. Below are charts illustrating the predicament the country finds itself in. <img class=" wp-image-300952 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Widening-deficit-1.png" alt="" width="793" height="491" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Widening-deficit-1.png 1296w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Widening-deficit-1-300x186.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Widening-deficit-1-768x475.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Widening-deficit-1-1024x634.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Widening-deficit-1-1200x743.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The National Treasury forecast a fiscal gap of 4.5% of gross domestic product for the year starting 1 April. If realised, it would be the worst since the 6.3% reported in fiscal 2010, and bigger than the estimate in a Bloomberg survey. <img class=" wp-image-300954 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sluggish.png" alt="" width="798" height="474" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sluggish.png 1296w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sluggish-300x178.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sluggish-768x456.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sluggish-1024x608.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Sluggish-1200x713.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The Treasury reduced the forecast for expansion in gross domestic product this year to 1.5% from 1.7% estimated in October, and cut growth predictions for the next two years. The economy hasn’t expanded by more than 2% since 2013. <img class=" wp-image-300956 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Worsening-debt.png" alt="" width="790" height="489" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Worsening-debt.png 1296w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Worsening-debt-300x186.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Worsening-debt-768x475.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Worsening-debt-1024x634.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Worsening-debt-1200x743.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Forecasts for gross debt as a percentage of GDP are worse than the October estimates for every year through 2027, with the figure expected to stabilise at 60.2% in 2023-24 compared with the prior prediction of 59.6% for the same year. The slippages come as the Treasury provides a R23 billion ($1.6 billion) lifeline to loss-making power utility Eskom in each of the next three years. <img class=" wp-image-300958 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Debt-burden.png" alt="" width="806" height="717" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Debt-burden.png 977w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Debt-burden-300x267.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Debt-burden-768x683.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The fastest-growing expenditure item in the budget is debt-servicing costs, with the country spending R182.2 billion in fiscal 2019, rising to R247 billion  by 2022. South Africa is ‘borrowing about R1.2 billion a day, assuming we don’t borrow money on the weekend,” Mboweni said. Read: The 2019 budget in a nutshell
