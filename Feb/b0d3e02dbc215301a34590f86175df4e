Huawei South Africa has announced a new partnership with Discovery Vitality. Speaking at an event in Sandton on Friday (1 February), channel manager at Huawei South Africa,  Lorraine Coleman, said that Vitality members will now be able to use their Vitality device booster benefits to receive discounts on some Huawei health devices. Coleman said that this will include a discount of between 25% – 75% on any Huawei device that has a heart rate monitor that is purchased from a Sportsmans Warehouse or Total Sports store. Speaking to BusinessTech, Huawei South Africa CTO Akhram Mohamed said that the announcement was part of a concerted health push by Huawei in 2019. He noted that the company has integrated a number of changes to the company’s cloud-based Health app, which now offers real-time heart rate monitoring, stress, sleep quality and oxygen intake, among other features. In addition, the company plans to launch a number of new wearable devices in the coming months and is in discussions with a host of other South African medical and health partners, he said. While Mohamed could not provide specifics on these partnerships, he said that Huawei was working on a number of existing technologies – including the possibility of sending detailed health information directly to your general practitioner.
