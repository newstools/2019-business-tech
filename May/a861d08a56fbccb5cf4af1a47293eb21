The Independent Electoral Commission has completed its task of counting the votes cast in the 2019 national elections. The ruling party, the ANC claimed 57.5% of the count â€“ though this reflects its worst performance in any national election. This was followed by the DA with 20.8% of the vote and the EFF with 10.8% of the vote. Smaller parties that made waves in the election include the IFP, the Freedom Front Plus, the ACDP and the UDM, all of whom will be returning to parliament this year. There were also a few parties who made their debut in the elections, and managed to secure at least some representation in parliament. This includes GOOD, led by former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, as well as the African Transformation Movement, headed up by former government spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi. The graph below outlines the final national results. <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-316200" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Final.png" alt="" width="744" height="813" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Final.png 1254w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Final-275x300.png 275w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Final-768x839.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Final-937x1024.png 937w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Final-1200x1311.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> While these figures represent the results of 100% of the votes counted by the IEC, the body did announce that over 1,000 voting stations would be audited amid claims of irregularities. No date has been provided for when the audits will take place or be completed. Provincial results Across the provinces, the ANC managed to secure an outright majority in almost all the regions, with the only exception being the Western Cape, where the DA maintained its majority. The party almost lost its majority in Gauteng, briefly dropping below 50% during the count, before ending on 50.19%. The graphs below outline the provincial results, showing the leading party and its closest competitors. The ANC secured a two-thirds majority in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape, and got over 50% of the vote in the Free State, Northern Cape and KwaZulu Natal. The EFF took over as the official opposition in three provinces, namely Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the North West. The IFP is the official opposition in KwaZulu Natal, and the DA is the official opposition in the rest (excluding the Western Cape, where the DA leads and the ANC is the official opposition). <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316170" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Limpopo.png" alt="" width="805" height="477" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Limpopo.png 1148w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Limpopo-300x178.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Limpopo-768x455.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Limpopo-1024x607.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
