Mugg & Bean has launched its first new-format ‘move thru’ store in South Africa. The Cape Town store – which opened on 13 May – is located at the corner of Woodlands Way and Sandown Road in Parklands. The new format is part of a strategic business move by the company to target customers who are on the move, the company said. “More than ten years ago, we partnered with Total and set up our ‘shop in shop’ retail concept with our On The Move stores across the country,” said Chad Manuel, product manager for Mugg & Bean On The Move. “We are not oblivious to the fact that these locations don’t necessarily serve high traffic areas in the Gauteng and Western Cape metropoles, so have launched the first Move Thru store as a time-sensitive detour that meets the commuter’s on the move coffee and snack demand.” Manuel said that Mugg & Bean plans to open more of these stores in the future. Mugg & Bean said that its new Move Thru stores will offer the same menu as its current On The Move stores. For those not interested in a ‘drive thru’, the store will also feature a sit-down element inside where you can catch up on emails at an ‘office away from the office’ with free Wi-Fi.
