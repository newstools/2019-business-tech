Transport minister Blade Nzimande opened the 2019 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) Conference this week, and gave a first glimpse of what a driverless South Africa could look like. During his visit to the conference at Sun City in the North West province, Nzimande and the president of the FIA, Jean Todt, took the opportunity to travel on the Navya Autonomous Electric Shuttle – the first autonomous, driverless, fully electric, commercially available vehicle to be demonstrated in South Africa. With neither a steering wheel nor pedals, the Navya Autonomous Electric Shuttle uses effective guidance and detection systems that combine various types of advanced technology. Data from sensors, cameras, GPS and odometry is merged and interpreted by deep learning programmes onboard the vehicle. Through this technology, the Navya Autonomous Electric Shuttle moves about efficiently and makes proficient decisions without any driver. “There are huge challenges in terms of mobility in our country and, certainly, this demonstration shows us what is out there right now,” said Sikkie Kajee, chairman of the Automobile Association of South Africa (AASA). “It may not necessarily be technology which will be implemented throughout South Africa tomorrow, but it is shining a light on where we think we need to be going. “Given the problems on our roads and the lack of reliable, affordable public transport, we need to be looking at innovative developments such as those offered by the Navya Autonomous Electric Shuttle, which can provide answers. ” <img class="size-full wp-image-314482 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Auto-2.png" alt="" width="944" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Auto-2.png 944w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Auto-2-300x229.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Auto-2-768x586.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-314480 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Auto-1.png" alt="" width="950" height="784" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Auto-1.png 950w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Auto-1-300x248.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Auto-1-768x634.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-314486 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-3-1024x682.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-3-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-3-1200x799.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-314488 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-4-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-4-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-4-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-4-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-4-1200x800.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="wp-image-314490 size-large aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-5-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-5-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-5-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-5-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-5-1200x800.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-314492 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-final-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-final-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-final-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-final-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shuttle-final-1200x800.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />  Read: New road taxes and 6 other changes that every South African motorist should know about
