Microsoft founder Bill Gates has published his summer reading list for 2019, highlighting the books that he deems to be important right now. In a blog post detailing the books, Gates said that none of the books can be considered a ‘light read’, while most of them focus on disruption in one way or another. “All but one deal with the idea of disruption, but I don’t mean “disruption” in the way tech people usually mean it,” Gates said. “I’ve recently found myself drawn to books about upheaval (that’s even the title of the one of them) – whether it’s the Soviet Union right after the Bolshevik revolution, the United States during times of war, or a global reevaluation of our economic system.” Here is his  full summer reading list: Upheaval, by Jared Diamond <img class="size-full wp-image-318548 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Upheaval.png" alt="" width="931" height="531" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Upheaval.png 931w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Upheaval-300x171.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Upheaval-768x438.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “I’m a big fan of everything Jared has written, and his latest is no exception. “The book explores how societies react during moments of crisis. He uses a series of fascinating case studies to show how nations managed existential challenges like civil war, foreign threats, and general malaise. “It sounds a bit depressing, but I finished the book even more optimistic about our ability to solve problems than I started.” Nine Pints, by Rose George <img class="size-full wp-image-318550 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nine-pints.png" alt="" width="942" height="554" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nine-pints.png 942w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nine-pints-300x176.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nine-pints-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “If you get grossed out by blood, this one probably isn’t for you. But if you’re like me and find it fascinating, you’ll enjoy this book by a British journalist with an especially personal connection to the subject. “I’m a big fan of books that go deep on one specific topic, so Nine Pints (the title refers to the volume of blood in the average adult) was right up my alley. “It’s filled with super-interesting facts that will leave you with a new appreciation for blood.” A Gentleman in Moscow, by Amor Towles <img class="size-full wp-image-318552 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gentleman.png" alt="" width="1082" height="557" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gentleman.png 1082w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gentleman-300x154.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gentleman-768x395.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gentleman-1024x527.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “It seems like everyone I know has read this book. I finally joined the club after my brother-in-law sent me a copy, and I’m glad I did. “Towles’s novel about a count sentenced to life under house arrest in a Moscow hotel is fun, clever, and surprisingly upbeat. “Even if you don’t enjoy reading about Russia as much as I do (I’ve read every book by Dostoyevsky), A Gentleman in Moscow is an amazing story that anyone can enjoy.” Presidents of War, by Michael Beschloss <img class="size-full wp-image-318554 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Presidents.png" alt="" width="956" height="557" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Presidents.png 956w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Presidents-300x175.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Presidents-768x447.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “My interest in all aspects of the Vietnam War is the main reason I decided to pick up this book. “By the time I finished it, I learned a lot not only about Vietnam but about the eight other major conflicts the US entered between the turn of the 19th century and the 1970s. “Beschloss’s broad scope lets you draw important cross-cutting lessons about presidential leadership.” The Future of Capitalism, by Paul Collier <img class="size-full wp-image-318556 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Future.png" alt="" width="1088" height="552" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Future.png 1088w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Future-300x152.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Future-768x390.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Future-1024x520.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “Collier’s latest book is a thought-provoking look at a topic that’s top of mind for a lot of people right now. “Although I don’t agree with him about everything—I think his analysis of the problem is better than his proposed solutions—his background as a development economist gives him a smart perspective on where capitalism is headed.” Read: The 10 business and finance books South Africans are reading right now
