Uber Eats has launched click and collect in South Africa, allowing customers to order and collect from their favourite restaurants. Uber said that the service will first launch in Johannesburg on Wednesday (22 May), with just under 400 restaurants participating including KFC’s, Krispy Kreme and Col’Cacchios and local favourites such as Banjaara, Coalition Pizza and Lexi’s Healthy Eatery. The price of the meals in-app will remain the same, and there is no charge to pick up a meal. “We want to support the growth of the restaurant industry and make our local communities more economically vibrant places to do business,” said Ailyssa Pretorius, GM of Uber Eats South Africa. “That’s why we’re launching a new service to help bricks and mortar restaurants grow their business, while providing users with a quick and convenient way to access food on-the-go. “Whether that’s grabbing a coffee on the way to work or skipping the queue during the lunchtime rush. Although this is primarily a test and learn opportunity, we look forward to receiving feedback from customers before optimising and expanding further,” she said. Since the start of 2019, Uber has been piloting pick-up services with 1,000 restaurants in the US cities of Austin, San Diego, Dallas and Phoenix. “While food delivery is the fastest growing sector of the restaurant industry, the vast majority of restaurant sales take place in-store – Pick-up and dine-in account for 80%+ of restaurant sales globally,” Uber said. “We believe Pick-Up could help create new incremental growth opportunities for bricks and mortar restaurants. “We expect to learn a lot over the coming weeks and we’re looking forward to getting feedback from customers as we seek to optimise the service before further expansion.” Read: New Uber competitor launches in Johannesburg and Cape Town – and it allows users to set their own prices
