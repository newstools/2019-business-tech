South Africans head to the polls today to vote in the country’s sixth national elections. Over 26.7 million people registered to vote in the 2019 elections, with around 70% of that number (18.7 million) expected to actually show up to vote today. The country’s close to 23,000 voting stations will remain open through to 21h00 this evening, with vote counts updating throughout the day. All results and information will come from the IEC’s Elections Results Centre in Pretoria.

The EFF, which contested the national vote for the first time that year, debuted at 6.4% of the vote. Looking at predictions for 2019, eyes will be on the ANC which is largely expected to show a decline in support (to between 55% and 60%) with the DA anticipated to also show a drop, or remain fairly flat (18% to 20%). The EFF, meanwhile, is expected to show a major boost in support numbers, with some outlets expecting around double the support (between 11% and 14%). <img class="aligncenter wp-image-315244" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-polls.png" alt="" width="897" height="441" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-polls.png 1994w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-polls-300x147.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-polls-768x377.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-polls-1024x503.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-polls-1200x590.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: South African election results: 2014 vs 2019 predictions
