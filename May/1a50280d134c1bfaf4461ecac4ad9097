Krispy Kreme will open a new store in Cape Town before the end of 2019. In an emailed statement Gerry Thomas, MD of Krispy Kreme South Africa said that the establishment of the brand in the Cape Town market is significant. “Product innovation, premium coffee and frozen beverages set our brand apart,” he said. “We can’t wait to touch and enhance lives in Cape Town through the joy of Krispy Kreme.” Krispy Kreme did not confirm where the store would be situated but said that it would be a ‘flagship location’. In 2015, Krispy Kreme announced that it has signed a development agreement with KK Doughnuts SA, to open 31 shops in South Africa until 2020 – marking the US-based company’s first venture into Africa. The store currently has 16 locations across the country as well as a number of ‘mini-locations’ through partnerships with Pick ‘n Pay, Total Bonjour & Engen Quickshops. The franchise will likely face lessened competition in Cape Town after Grand Parade Investments announced it would be shuttering its Dunkin Donuts stores in March.
