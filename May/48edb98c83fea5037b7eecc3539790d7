Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: South Africa’s major political parties held their final election rallies this weekend. The ANC promised to stamp out corruption. The EFF said that it was the party for the poor who the ANC had abandoned. And the DA urged voters to skip the ANC and EFF’s lies and vote for real change. [M&G, Business Day] The IEC says it is ready for the 2019 elections, which kick off today with the special votes. The group says it expects no incidents, but has contingencies in place in case anything happens. This includes strike teams and police presence – particularly in gang areas where problems could occur. [ENCA] EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu has been further implicated in underhanded dealings with businessmen, requesting what appears to be payments – despite not declaring any of these interests to parliament. A new investigation by amaBhungane and the Daily Maverick unveils more. [Daily Maverick] The City of Cape Town does not have a system in place to allow motorists to submit dash-cam footage of motorists committing road crimes. The city said that officers have to witness the crime themselves and have their own recordings. The City of Joburg recently opened up a platform for this. [702] South Africa’s rand firmed on Friday as a modest US jobs report weighed on the dollar, although many investors stayed on the sidelines with national elections just a few days away. On Monday the rand was at R14.48 to the dollar, R19.00 to the pound and R16.21 to the euro.
