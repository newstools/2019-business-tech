South African smartphone brand, Mobicel has launched the Trendy 2 – an affordable LTE-enabled smartphone that runs on the Android PGo platform. The new phone is the successor to the Trendy Smartphone and offers a range of value-added features and powerful specifications for R899. Device highlights include a 5.45-inch display, a 2 megapixel front camera, 5 megapixel back camera and 8GB of onboard memory. The integrated 4G/LTE capability, meanwhile, allows entry-level users to enjoy a better experience when using bandwidth-intensive applications such as video and music streaming. The Trendy 2 will run on Android PGo, the Go edition of the latest version of the Android operating system. “It prioritises your apps based on how often you use them, ensuring that the apps you seldom or never use won’t drain on your battery life. It can even monitor how you use certain apps and run the in-app features you use most in the foreground for your convenience. “PGo makes data about how you use your device available to you, so you can see how much time you spend on your phone, which apps you spend the most time on, and your habits at particular times of the day. You can use this info to set daily, weekly and monthly limits on your app and data usage. Your phone will alert you when you’ve reached these ceilings,” Mobicel said.
