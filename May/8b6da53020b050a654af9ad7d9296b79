WeWork has announced a new membership deal with Naspers, which is relocating its Johannesburg team to the shared workspace in Rosebank when it opens in August 2019. WeWork 173 Oxford Road, will be in the heart of Rosebank near one of the main arteries which connects the north and south of Johannesburg. Over 400,000 members are now based at WeWork locations globally, and member businesses range from start-ups to mid- and large-sized companies. International locations serve as a base for business travel, as well as offer opportunities for companies to easily expand abroad. WeWork membership comes with internet access, cleaning, and furniture. Members can choose from a variety of membership plans, which include “hot-desking,” or using available desks, or a private, noise-controlled office. “We’re thrilled to be welcoming Naspers into the WeWork community in our first location in South Africa. The deal recognises WeWork’s dedication to larger enterprise companies who now make up more than 30% of our global membership,” said Giulio Limongelli, head of growth for WeWork EMEA. “We continue to expand across EMEA and I’m pleased to announce that we’ve just celebrated our 100,000th member joining the community here.” Read: US workspace provider WeWork is launching in Joburg
