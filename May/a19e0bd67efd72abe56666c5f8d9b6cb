With over 81% of the national votes in the 2019 election finalised, South Africans are getting a clearer picture of where the various political parties stand. Nationally, the ANC currently leads with a 57.08% share of the vote, with 82.67% of voting stations finalised. The DA has secured 21.63% so far, with the EFF following in third at 10.12%. Looking at provincial legislatures, the ANC has secured a majority in seven of the nine provinces, with only the Western Cape being run by a different majority party (the DA) and Gauteng currently showing a share under 50% for the ANC. Gauteng has emerged as the most hotly contested province in election, with opposition parties pushing hard to pull the ANC below 50% to topple the majority it has held in the area since 1994. In the province, by 11h30 around 62% of voting districts the province were captured – and the ANC has now dropped below the 50% barrier and currently stands at 49.56%. While the official opposition in the province will likely chalk this up as a victory, the ANC’s loss not the DA’s gain. The DA currently has 28.48% of the vote, which is lower than its share of 30.78% in 2014. The EFF, meanwhile, has increased its share from 10.3% in 2014, to 13.88% in 2019 so far. Keeping on trend as the biggest surprise grower of the 2019 elections, the Freedom Front Plus has seen it support base more than triple in Gauteng, currently standing at 3.96%, up from just 1.2% in 2014. Other provinces In other major provinces, the status quo has been held. The DA has a firm lead in the Western Cape with 55.54% of the vote, and almost all ballots counted (98%), with the ANC trailing behind at 28.57%, and the EFF at 4.0%. ANC head of election Fikile Mbalula conceded defeat in the province earlier on Friday, saying that the party had failed at its goal to pull the DA below 50% in the province. In KwaZulu Natal, meanwhile, the ANC looks set to secure its majority, with a share of 53.47%, on 75% of the votes counted. KZN was earmarked by some polls as having the potential to be another loss for the governing party – particularly with the resurgence seen by the IFP in the province. The IFP has increased its share of the vote to 17.31%, up from 10.86% in 2014. The DA is third in the province with 14.3% of the vote (up from 12.76%), while the EFF has made significant inroads, now having a support base of 9.13%, up from 1.85% in 2014.
