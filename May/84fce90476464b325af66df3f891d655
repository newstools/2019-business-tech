The UK’s Sunday Times has published its Rich List for 2019, with nine South Africans and their families making the cut. According to the paper, amid heightening political uncertainty around Brexit, many of Britain’s wealthiest people have moved their assets elsewhere, ‘to make it easy to wire their money out of the country at a moment’s notice’. Many have taken a beating, and have been nursing big losses to their bank balances. However, despite the pain, the list presents another record year for the super-wealthy, The Times said. The combined wealth of the 1,000 entrants has risen to £771.13 billion – up £47.776 billion in 2018 (where the total was £724 billion). The billionaire count has also risen to a record 151 – up six from last year. Topping the Rich List in 2019 are the Indian-born business brothers, Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who run the Hinduja Group conglomerate. The Hinduja’s have business dealings in many fields, including imports, banking, vehicles and healthcare. In 2019 the brothers commanded a net worth of £22 billion (R409 billion), placing them above second-placed property investors David and Simon Reuben – who are worth £18.66 billion (R347 billion). To be featured on the list, you would need £120 million to get onto the bottom rung — up from £115 million in 2018. “The rich are definitely getting richer, but the names of our wealthiest individuals and families are constantly changing,” the paper said. South Africans The list covers individuals and families in the country, including many businessmen and women who have dual citizenship (through business, investments or residency). Nine South African born individuals appear on the list, including Nicky Oppenheimer and Nathan Kirsh who regularly feature on the Forbes wealth list. Also on the list is tech entrepreneur Mark Shuttlerworth, who is domiciled on the Isle of Man. Oppenheimer was the highest-ranked South African, with a net worth of £5.66 billion – approximately R105 billion at current rates.
