Hotly-contested elections The 2019 national elections are set to be one of the most hotly contested since the dawn of democracy, with many stakeholders – from businesses to investors and opposition parties – keeping a close eye on the ANC’s performance. The ANC, which has secure strong majorities in elections since 1994, has seen its support base dwindle following a disastrous period under Jacob Zuma. However, the party’s 2019 political campaign has hinged on change within the party, and a promise of a new dawn to correct the mistakes of the last decade. The country’s biggest opposition party, the DA, meanwhile has faced problems of its own. After showing growth in support in each election the party has contested, pre-election polling shows that it may suffer its first decline. The party has been beset by in-fighting between leaders, which culminated in the exit (or expulsion) of former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, who set up her own party, GOOD, to contest the 2019 election. With wobbles in both the ANC and DA, it’s the EFF that has emerged as a party that could benefit. Read: What a big loss for the ANC in the 2019 elections means for South Africa
