An updated count on South Africa’s election results on Friday morning showed the ruling party, the ANC headed toward victory, although well below its count from five years ago. By 07h00, about 17,208 of 22,925 of the voting districts or 75.06% had declared their results. The tallies up on the large leader board at the IEC’s national results centre in Pretoria, place the African National Congress (ANC) in the lead with 57.21% of the votes, the Democratic Alliance (DA) at 21.84% of the votes and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) at 10.08%. These are, so far, the leading three parties in the race for the national government. They are followed by the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which is currently standing at 2.89%, the Freedom Front Plus (VF Plus) at 2.48%, African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) with 0.92% of the votes and the United Democratic Movement (UDM) at 0.53%. Over 26 million voters were registered to vote in Wednesday’s elections, but the Electoral Commission count thus far puts the voter turnout at 65.44%. Political parties went into the polls with different targets. The ANC wanted to stay in power with over 60% of the voters support; the DA wanted to grow its party support, while the EFF was hoping to double their support. However, so far the biggest surprise in these elections is the performance of the VF Plus which has gained more voters in the provinces.

Rand reaction Bianca Botes, corporate treasury manager at Peregrine Treasury Solutions said that the rand traded mostly flat during local trading sessions, while experiencing some relief in the overnight sessions. “The local election has come and gone and, as expected, the ANC is leading the national race, with the CSIR predicting a 57.4% result for the ANC, followed by the DA at 21.5% and the EFF as 9.5%. “While the win by the ANC has been largely expected to be rand positive, the current global risk-off environment affected by the US-China trade dynamic has put a dampener on the performance of the local currency,” Botes said. “As the ANC win is digested, markets will swiftly shift their focus to the subsequent actions of the ruling partly, including the announcement of Cabinet by president Cyril Ramaphosa, the State of the Nation address due to follow in June, as well as policies relating to expropriation of land without compensation. “A key focus as we head in to post-election season will be Eskom and the anticipated restructuring of the power utility as this dilemma remains the biggest threat to economic growth.” Botes said that the global dynamic is largely overshadowing the local developments in terms of elections, “and for the time being we are playing wait and see regarding the threats made by president Donald Trump”. Should The follow through on his trade threats, the rand could once again lean towards weakness, potentially targeting R14.60/$, Botes said. “The flip side, however, should an agreement be reached and Trump does not impose additional tariffs, sees markets resetting to risk-on dynamics, while refocusing on the local elements at play. This could see the rand gain some momentum on the back of carry trade, to target levels as low as R14.10. All we can do now is wait. “The broader range of the rand has been between R14.35 and R14.48, occasionally rising in the overnight session to R14.30, with key support and resistance at R14.30 and R14.50.” The local unit traded at the following levels against the major currencies, shortly before 09h00 on Friday: Dollar/Rand: R14.28  (-0.42%)
Pound/Rand: R18.59  (-0.36%)
