New luxury accommodation housed inside a restored train is set to open in the Kruger National Park at the end of 2019. The train will feature 24 rooms offering 48 beds in train rooms, stationed on the Selati Bridge, spanning the Sabie river from bank to bank. The train lodge features a lounge carriage with bar and deck and pool for relaxing, and lounging space with game viewing opportunities from the vista atop the river. According to developers, the Thebe Tourism Group, the train in its stationary position with an external walkway attached to the bridge structure allows the Kruger Shalati’s rooms to be much larger than the expected traditional train compartment-style room – complete with floor-to-ceiling windows. The lodge also boasts seven land-based rooms in Bridge House – right next to the train – overlooking the river and the train on the bridge. One of these rooms can be set up as family suites with dedicated children areas and a honeymoon suite, the developers said. The bridge house dining and lounge areas include decked seating and a pool overlooking the Sabie river. <img class="size-full wp-image-319014 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-6.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="698" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-6.jpg 960w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-6-300x218.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-6-768x558.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-318992 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-1.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="700" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-1.jpg 1400w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-1-1200x600.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-318994 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-2.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="700" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-2.jpg 1400w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-2-1200x600.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-318998 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-4.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="700" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-4.jpg 1400w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-4-768x384.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-4-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-4-1200x600.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-319012 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-5.png" alt="" width="1736" height="778" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-5.png 1736w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-5-300x134.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-5-768x344.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-5-1024x459.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shalati-5-1200x538.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Reservations and booking The Thebe Tourism Group said that the train lodge will first open with 16 carriage rooms (32 beds) and seven land rooms (14 beds) in December 2019.
