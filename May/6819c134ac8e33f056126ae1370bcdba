Former president Jacob Zuma, along with ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule, have been linked to a new political party, the African Transformation Movement (ATM), reports the Sunday Times. The paper cites an alleged affidavit deposed by the general secretary of the South African Council of Messianic Churches in Christ (SACMCC), Buyisile Ngqulwana. The new party intends to contest the coming election, while Ngqulwana details “consultation sessions” with both Zuma and Magashule about an alternative party to the Cyril Ramaphosa-led ANC, the Sunday Times said. The religious body claims to have 30 million members — while the ATM will reportedly look to use its base in those churches when it goes to the polls. “Zuma’s hand in the formation of the party has been the subject of speculation in ANC circles. Now, for the first time, Ngqulwana’s affidavit links him directly to its formation. “In the affidavit, Ngqulwana puts Zuma and Magashule at the centre of the formation of the council and the new party,” the Sunday Times said. In April 2018, the ATC applied for registration with the Independent Electoral Commission. ANC factions Factions in the ANC continue to sabotage the policy initiative and undermine president Cyril Ramaphosa’s efforts to revive the economy, Robert Schrire, a political science professor at the University of Cape Town, recently said. Opposition troubles The ANC is not the only party which has faced speculation of a split in recent months. Several senior members of the Democratic Alliance, South Africa’s official opposition, have considered breaking away to form a new party because of disputes about its policy direction, Bloomberg reported recently, citing ‘people familiar with the matter’.
