Huawei is hosting the 2019 Shenzhen Smart City Forum With International Friendship Cities from May 14 to 15, 2019. The technology company has its headquarters in Shenzhen, and is home to around 30,000 employees out of a total of 188,000 in 170 countries globally. The forum has attracted global experts and scholars with advanced smart city experience, with enterprises providing cutting-edge technologies and open discussion on current trends for smart cities. The smart city urban development trend creates a favorable environment for industry development, enterprises, and residents. “Since smart cities have become a global consensus, city managers worldwide have begun to explore digital transformation to create smarter, safer communities,” Huawei said. “This forum will share how to integrate Cloud Computing, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The integration will help city managers build a secure, intelligent, convenient, and efficient social and economic environment, achieve sustainable, steady urbanization, as well as make cities more competitive,” it said.
