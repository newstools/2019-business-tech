Gambling is a multi-billion rand industry in South Africa, that brought in close to R30 billion in gross winnings for casinos in 2018. While this figure includes sports betting, horse racing and even bingo – the largest portion of revenue is drawn from casinos. In 2018, South Africa’s gambling industry brought in total turnover (money wagered) of R390 billion – R276.5 billion from casinos. Gross Gambling Revenue (GGR) for the whole industry was at R28.7 billion, with casinos taking R18.42 billion – representing a 93.3% payout (in winnings). Casinos have some of the highest payout rates among the different types of gambling, second only to bingo. But even with such a large proportion of take going back into the pockets of gamblers, the house still wins big – very big. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319048" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Casino-Turnover.png" alt="" width="889" height="437" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Casino-Turnover.png 889w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Casino-Turnover-300x147.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Casino-Turnover-768x378.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-319046" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Casino-net-win.png" alt="" width="889" height="433" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Casino-net-win.png 889w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Casino-net-win-300x146.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Casino-net-win-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Hotel and casino gaming group Tsogo Sun published its annual results for the year ended March 2019 on Thursday (23 May), showing strong growth in its gambling segment.
