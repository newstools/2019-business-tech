Nissan has launched its new Navara Stealth in South Africa. The Navara Stealth comes in 2-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive configuration featuring the Navara twin turbo engine with 140kW power and 450Nm torque, as well as a 7-speed automatic transmission and a 5-link coil rear suspension. Modelled on the Nissan Navara luxury edition, the Navara Stealth replaces the standard silver and chrome detailing on the exterior with sleek, black trims. Nissan has also added orange accents to the grill, front bumper, side mirrors and side steps. This two-tone colouration is carried through into the interior, with seats featuring black leather side bolsters and orange material inserts and stitching. The Stealth also comes with an array of Nissan Intelligent Mobility technologies including: Intelligent Key System;
Intelligent 4×4 System – which assists drivers in smooth cornering by adjusting power output to the front and rear wheels;
Intelligent Around View Monitor, which uses four cameras positioned at different points around the pickup to give the driver a 360-degree, aerial view of the vehicle and its surrounds;
Hill Start Assistance. Nissan said that pricing for the Navara Stealth will start at R582,200, including a comprehensive 3-year/90,000km service plan plus a class-leading 6-year/150,000km warranty with Nissan Assured.
