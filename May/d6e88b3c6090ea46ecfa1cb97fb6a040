The April index dipped below the 100-mark at 96 index points, indicating increased competition for jobs among job seekers, the group said. Jobs fell by 9% while job search activity slowed by 4%. “Due to the high number of public holidays in April, many sectors have seen a notable decrease in job availability.

This trend is particularly notable in the sales sector while the road to recovery is slower in the marketing and medical sectors, CareerJunction said. Jobs in the admin, office & support, business & management and construction sectors remain considerably lower than the same period last year. April saw a notable decrease in jobs due to the high number of public holidays, particularly in the business & management sector where job volumes are 29% lower year-on-year. Meanwhile, the engineering, manufacturing, finance and ICT sectors saw an expected dip in job volumes recently due to the school and public holidays.
