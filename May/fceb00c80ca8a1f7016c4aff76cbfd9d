Recruitment specialist Glassdoor has published a new guide on writing the perfect CV in 2019 – including the two biggest mistakes prospective employees make. The most common issue is that people simply write too much, said Glassdoor. “Just because you have more leeway when crafting a CV doesn’t mean you have to include everything you’ve ever accomplished — at some point, you’ll get off topic and a hiring manager will stop reading,” it said. “The key is to back each assertion with evidence. If you can’t give a reason for why an experience should be included, it probably shouldn’t be a part of your CV.” The second major issue is that as CVs get longer and more complicated, they tend to lose their ‘readability’, said Glassdoor. Since CVs are longer than resumes, it’s easy to type away while missing grammar or spelling mistakes, it said. “Submitting a CV with basic errors, especially in an academic context, is a huge red flag. Make sure you’ve thoroughly edited your writing — don’t depend solely on SpellCheck. “After you’ve reviewed your CV, ask a colleague or advisor to read it over. A pair of fresh eyes will catch any basic errors, suggest accomplishments to include that you may have forgotten and (most importantly) let you know if your CV is comprehensible to another person. “As with all applications, double check you have spelled the name of the organization and the person who you are addressing correctly before submitting.” Read: The 10 business and finance books South Africans are reading right now
