The South African Electoral Commission has published the full list of politicians who will make up the sixth Parliament of South Africa – including some controversial names. Following the outcome of the 2019 elections, 14 parties will make up the new Parliament – led by the ANC. The ANC has dominated Parliament since it rose to power after the 1994 elections but has now dropped below 60% for the first time. With a support base of 57.5%, the ANC has lost 19 seats in Parliament, now commanding 230 positions. This puts the party 35 seats short of a two-thirds majority. The ANC was not the only party to lose out, with the DA also slipping in numbers. The DA had 89 seats in the previous Parliament and has lost five of those (for a total of 84). The biggest winner is the EFF, who added 19 seats, taking its total to 44. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-316462" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Parliament-fixed.png" alt="" width="801" height="621" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Parliament-fixed.png 1266w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Parliament-fixed-300x232.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Parliament-fixed-768x595.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Parliament-fixed-1024x793.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Parliament-fixed-1200x930.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Among the list of published names, a few controversial figures will be making their return to the seat of government, including former finance and home affairs minister, Malusi Gigaba; former social development minister Bathabile Dlamini; former mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane; and former water and sanitation minister Nomvula Mokonyane. These officials have been mired in controversy, hailing from the Zuma presidency. Gigaba stepped down as home affairs minister and resigned as a member of parliament in November 2018, following court rulings that he had lied under oath. He was also implicated in the dealings of the Gupta family and the state capture scandal. Zwane as also been implicated in Gupta affairs, and was widely criticised for working against the South African mining industry by pushing an anti-business mining charter. He was shuffled out of government when Cyril Ramaphosa took over as president. Most recently, Mokonyane was implicated in alleged bribery in the Bosasa saga – while Dlamini has been criticised for allegedly orchestrating the 2017 social grants crisis, and wasting millions of rands in taxpayers’ money. Both politicians kept a place in government after Ramaphosa took the helm, with Dlamini becoming minister of women in the presidency, and Mokonyane moving to environmental affairs. The ANC was called out by opposition parties ahead of the 2019 elections for keeping these names on its election lists. However, analysts have pointed out that they remain popular leaders within the party, and would have sown divisions among factions within the ANC had they been omitted. While these figures have been re-elected to parliament, it will be up to president Cyril Ramaphosa to determine if they will have a place in national government. New parties Among the names are representatives of new parties who earned enough votes to head to Parliament in 2019. From GOOD, party leader Patricia de Lille and former bodyguard Shaun August will take the party’s two seats. Mzwanele Mayni is absent from the ATM’s representation in parliament, with party president Vuyolwethu Zungula and former Eastern Cape ANC MEC Thandiswa Marawu showing for the party. The first sitting of the sixth Parliament of South Africa will be on 22 May 2019 – with Ramaphosa expected to announce a new cabinet before the end of the month.
