The DA said that the new cabinet was not reformed enough to make any difference to South Africa’s struggles (adding the Patricia de Lille’s appointment was purely political) – while the EFF said the cabinet was a declaration of war, as it included Pravin Gordhan, who the party says is corrupt and unconstitutional.

[Bloomberg] Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has rejected claims that she is unfairly targeting Pravin Gordhan, saying that he is one of many people her office is investigating. She said she is looking into complaints against former ministers Bathabile Dlamini and Nomvula Mokonyane, and denied political interference.

On Thursday the rand was trading at R14.62 to the dollar, R18.48 to the pound and R16.29 to the euro.
