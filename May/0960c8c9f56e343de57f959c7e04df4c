The South African Equality Court has found that the Black First Land First (BLF) political slogan “Land or Death” is hate speech. As part of its ruling, the court ordered the political party to remove the slogan from the public domain – including social media accounts and branded apparel – within the next month. The BLF were also instructed to issue a written apology for the slogan. While the finding will not have any major repercussions for the party, it may also face further criminal prosecution based on the findings of this judgement. The BLF will contest the 2019 national elections for the first time amidst controversy surrounding its registration with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). In its bid to have the BLF deregistered, the FF Plus approached the Electoral Court last Monday (29 April) where it argued that the registration of the BLF was not published in the Government Gazette, reports News 24. The FF Plus were arguing that there were procedural irregularities regarding the registration of BLF and were calling for it to not be part of the May 8 elections.
