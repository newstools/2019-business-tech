The Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) is looking to open a number of new stations in the coming years – including routes through Lanseria, Fourways, and Boksburg. In 2017, the Gautrain Management Agency (GMA) announced that it would be conducting a feasibility study into the expansion of the network, with 12 new train sets also required. “The feasibility study concludes that the extension of the Gautrain rail network will provide significant economic and transport related benefits to the province and the country at large; that it offers value for money, and appropriate risk transfer if procured as a public-private partnership,” it said. It added that through its modelling process, it became clear that the ‘cost of doing nothing’ in the province will lead to major road congestion in 2037 – at which stage cars will travel at an average of 15 kilometres an hour due to doubling of car growth. Speaking to BusinessTech, GMA senior executive manager for communication and marketing, Dr Barbara Jensen, said that the GMA has now completed the feasibility study and submitted it to the National Treasury for approval. “Once approval has been granted the planning and Environmental Impact Assessment of Phase 1 will begin,” she said. Among others, the expansion will include new stations in: Boksburg;
The East Rand Mall;
Irene;
Mamelodi;
Sunninghill
Fourways;
Roodepoort;
Lanseria.
