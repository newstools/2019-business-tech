A South African election outcome that sees the ruling party win 55-60% of the vote could boost shares in banks and insurers, retailers, locally focused industrial companies, property firms and telcos, according to UBS Group AG. A victory of that magnitude for the African National Congress in the May 8 poll is a result seen by many as enabling President Cyril Ramaphosa to lead ‘in a less constrained way,’ said Aveshen Pillay, director of equity derivatives sales and structuring at UBS in Johannesburg. UBS last week listed two products on the Johannesburg exchange that allow investors to position for a new surge of ‘Ramaphoria’ after the election. A strong showing for the ANC may trigger a rally in South African assets on expectations of greater policy certainty, better management of state-owned companies and an improved outlook for growth, Pillay said in an emailed response to questions. UBS has listed a basket of 20 stocks correlated to rand strength, including financials, retailers, industrials, property and telcos. The second of the six-month products is based on a group of 10 domestically focused, “South Africa Inc.” stocks tipped to benefit most from lower bond yields, a stronger currency and improved growth and consumer sentiment. While South African equities look expensive, “opportunities exist within sectors such as financials and property stocks benefiting from lower bond yields, and retailers and food producers on attractive valuations relative to history and exposed to the consumer,” Pillay said. South Africa’s benchmark index dropped 0.4% as of 14:49 in Johannesburg Monday, trimming its advance this year to 11%. Here are some of UBS’s preferred South African stocks in the lead up to the election, detailed in a 16 April report co-authored by Pillay. <img class="size-full wp-image-313978 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shares.png" alt="" width="1200" height="1192" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shares.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shares-150x150.png 150w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shares-300x298.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shares-768x763.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shares-1024x1017.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shares-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />  Banks Absa Group;
