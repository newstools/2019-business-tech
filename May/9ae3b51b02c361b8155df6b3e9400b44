McCormick Property Development (MPD) has announced that it will begin moving ahead with Capital Mall, a R1.2 billion mega-development in Pretoria West. The development has been stuck in limbo, but an appeal to halt the development was overturned during a sitting of the City of Tshwane’s Municipal Appeals Tribunal (MAT) in April, the developers said. “With direct access approved off both the N4 highway and WF Nkomo (Church) Street and situated on the planned N4/R55 interchange, the double level mall will anchor ‘Capital City’ – a R5 billion mixed-use development,” MPD said. “The development node includes a 150-bed private hospital, value retail centre, motor dealerships, affordable housing, student housing, schooling and community facilities.” The development of the mall will be phased with 60,000 sqm Gross Leasable Area (GLA) planned to open towards the end of 2021. MPD said that the design allows the mall to seamlessly expand to over 100,000 sqm in time, without the need for structured parking facilities. Shopping centres in South Africa According to a 2018 report by MSCI on behalf of the South African Council of Shopping Centres l, the South African market had 418 square meters of the shopping centre lettable area for every 1,000 people. The US is rated as having the most shopping centres relative to its population with 2,196 square meters/1,000 capita – followed by Canada, Australia and Norway. However South Africa, Canada and the US have the highest level of shopping centre supply expressed relative to household consumption expenditure. Despite this demand,  South Africa’s current shopping centre development pipeline suggests a slowdown in new mall completions for the period 2018-2020 which, combined with a predicted improvement in economic growth, may see South Africa’s shopping centre segment move lower and closer to the global average. <img class="size-full wp-image-315266 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Mall-Aerial.jpg" alt="" width="1900" height="773" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Mall-Aerial.jpg 1900w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Mall-Aerial-300x122.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Mall-Aerial-768x312.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Mall-Aerial-1024x417.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Mall-Aerial-1200x488.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-315264 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Big-2.png" alt="" width="1084" height="605" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Big-2.png 1084w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Big-2-300x167.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Big-2-768x429.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-Big-2-1024x572.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-315260 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-big-1.png" alt="" width="766" height="443" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-big-1.png 766w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Capital-big-1-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-225497 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="513" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-4.jpg 800w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-4-300x192.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-4-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-225495 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-3.jpg" alt="" width="1110" height="605" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-3.jpg 1110w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-3-300x164.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-3-768x419.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Capital-Mall-3-1024x558.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: South Africa retailers seek post-election boost as belts tighten
