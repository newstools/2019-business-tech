Abland and Tiber – joint developers of the Sandton Gate precinct – say they are on track to complete the first phase of the city’s new mixed-use development. Construction on the project kicked off in June 2018, with six phases of development planned in total. The first phase is expected to be complete by the end of 2019, with the residential component ready by the fourth quarter of 2020. The first phase includes 15,500 square metres of commercial space, 13,000 square metres of premium-grade office space and a 2,500 square metre Planet Fitness positioned on the piazza level of the building. Confirmed tenants, who include Mimecast, will call Sandton Gate home as of 1 November 2019, the developers said. “Due to the high demand following the launch of phase one, we aim to break ground for phase two in 2020,” the developers said. “We’ve redesigned phase two to include more retail offerings that will include a grocery store and pharmacy as anchor tenants, as well as a hotel and a holistic medical offering.” Other amenities will include restaurants, coffee shops, salons and other convenience stores. The residential component of the precinct – which will comprise 137 units of two and three bedroom penthouses – has launched and infrastructural work and the bulk earthworks have started. With the completion of residential first phase envisaged for Q4 2020, the developers are aiming to hit their pre-sale target by August this year which means construction of top structure will commence Q4 2019. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-316700" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sandton-gate-building-1.png" alt="" width="997" height="562" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sandton-gate-building-1.png 997w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sandton-gate-building-1-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sandton-gate-building-1-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-316698" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sandton-gate-construction.png" alt="" width="995" height="661" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sandton-gate-construction.png 995w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sandton-gate-construction-300x199.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sandton-gate-construction-768x510.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Jurgens Prinsloo, MD  at Abland said that the project won’t ignore road upgrades, due to the size of the project. “Abland undertook extensive traffic impact assessments to get an idea of the traffic impact once the project is complete. As part of the infrastructural advancements, a new intersection on William Nicol between Mattie and Sandton Drive is currently underway. Prinsloo said that there will also be an introduction of additional lanes to ensure seamless access to the precinct and decrease potential congestion around the area. “Ultimately, there are seven substantial upgrades that we’re doing ranging from the Peter Place intersection, Republic intersection, Mattie intersection, Sandton Drive and William Nicol,” he said. <img class="aligncenter
