President Cyril Ramaphosa has been tipped to appoint a new deputy president as part of his cabinet changes this week. South African deputy president David Mabuza’s reappointment to his post was cast into doubt on Wednesday (22 May), after he asked to delay his swearing-in as a lawmaker. Mabuza asked to delay the process “in light of a report by the ANC Integrity Commission in which he is alleged to have prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organization into disrepute,” Ramaphosa said in a statement. Under the constitution, his deputy must be selected from among the ranks of the 400 lawmakers, meaning Mabuza could be disqualified if he doesn’t clear his name in the next few days. Possible replacements Speaking to News24, ANC sources said that Ramaphosa is likely to appoint a female as his deputy when he announces his cabinet after the presidential inauguration on Saturday (25 May). Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and minister of Higher Education Naledi Pandor have been mentioned as possible candidates. ANC treasurer general and former Gauteng premier, Paul Mashatile, has also been named as a possible ‘wildcard’ selection. Dlamini-Zuma stood as a main opponent in the most recent ANC presidential election, only narrowly missing out on victory by a slim margin. Her election to deputy-president may be seen as a move by Ramaphosa to appease some ANC factions, including the Women’s League. Pandor has held a number of cabinet positions including roles as minister of Home Affairs and minister of Science and Technology. She served as Ramaphosa’s original choice for deputy president at Nasrec, but lost out to Mabuza during the last ANC meeting. Read: South African deputy president David Mabuza’s reappointment in doubt
