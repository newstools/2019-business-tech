Low-cost airline FlySafair has launched its R5 a flight sale for 2019. According to the company’s website, 45,000 tickets will officially go on sale at 09h00 on Tuesday morning (7 May), ending at 17h00, or when all tickets are sold out. “The R5 tickets include all airport taxes and VAT, but exclude any additional services such as (but not limited to) checked luggage, priority boarding and seat pre-selection,” it said. “FlySafair will make a selection of one-way flight tickets available for sale at R5. “These tickets will only be available for selected departures between 08 May 2019 and end September 2019.” The airline warned that access to the website to make a purchase would be limited by means of a ‘waiting room’ facility – designed to preserve the integrity of the website and protect it against the heavy traffic demand. Shortly before the sale was due to go live, the airline said that its website was facing some technical difficulties, but that it was working to rectify the problem.
