Stats SA has published its latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey for the first quarter of 2019, showing that the country’s unemployment rate has risen in the first three months of the year. This puts the current rate 0.5 percentage points higher than the last quarter of 2018 – where it sat at 27.1%. Including ‘discouraged work seekers’ this put the expanded unemployment rate at 38%, Stats SA said. The data is in line with what the market expected, following several indicators of slow growth in the first quarter of the year. It is also in line with seasonal trends, where many sectors end up laying off the temporary staff hired to work over the busy festive period. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-316808" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Employment-map.png" alt="" width="883" height="645" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Employment-map.png 883w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Employment-map-300x219.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Employment-map-768x561.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> According to Stats SA, the number of employed persons decreased by 237,000 to 16.3 million in Q1 2019, while the number of unemployed persons increased by 62,000 to 6.2 million compared to Q4 2018.

The absorption rate decreased by 0.7 of a percentage point to 42.6% and the unemployment rate increased by 0.5 of a percentage point to 27.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.
