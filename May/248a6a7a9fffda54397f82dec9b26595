Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: With 75% of voting station ballots counted, the outcome of the 2019 elections has become clear. At 57.2% of the vote currently, the ANC has secured another majority win, though with a major loss of support. The DA has also dropped slightly with 21.8%, while the EFF has managed to enter the double digits at 10.1%. [IEC] The provincial battle is heating up in Gauteng, with the ANC currently holding onto its majority by a thread, but it’s game over for the party in the Western Cape, with the ANC admitting defeat. The party said it wanted to cut the DA to below 50% in the province, but conceded it had failed. [ENCA] The final vote announcement could be delayed, as the IEC investigates claims of voter fraud. The body said that it will only announce the final vote – currently scheduled for tomorrow – when it is 100% confident in the integrity of the numbers. There are claims that some people voted twice, due to ID and ink issues. [EWN] The ANC has rubbished talk of an internal plot to remove president Cyril Ramaphosa after the election, saying that the only way the party can remove a president is by setting up an early election conference or special conference, which needs buy-in from a majority of the provinces. Ramaphosa will stay until 2022, when the next elective conference will be held. [News24] South Africa’s rand gave up its earlier gains on Thursday as another round of risk selling in global markets fuelled by the US-China trade talks outweighed local election positives. On Friday the rand was at R14.33 to the dollar, R18.65 to the pound and R16.10 to the euro.
