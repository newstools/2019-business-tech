Capitec says it will launch a new-look banking card and redesigned banking app within the next two months. Speaking at the group’s AGM on Friday (31 May), chief executive Gerrie Fourie said that the next 12 to 18 months would see a number of exciting new developments, particularly in the digital payments and credit space, while in the next two months clients can expect some visual changes. The first change comes in the form of a new ‘black’ Capitec Global One debit card, that sports the same vertical design popularised by Discovery Bank. The vertical design was chosen because “we don’t swipe anymore”, the bank said, noting that the new card would have full tap-and-go functionality. It features platinum gold typeface and either red or blue bordering, in line with the group’s corporate colour scheme. The second big change is the group’s redesigned banking app, which will give existing clients full control of their accounts and the new card, while also allowing onboarding of new clients through facial recognition technology – the so-called “selfie banking” that has already debuted at other local banks. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-320759" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Banking-app.png" alt="" width="619" height="403" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Banking-app.png 1742w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Banking-app-300x196.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Banking-app-768x501.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Banking-app-1024x668.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Banking-app-1200x783.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Digital future Fourie said that digital is a key focus area for the bank. To this end, he said that the group has a dedicated team of around 200 individuals working in the digital and artificial intelligence sector. He said that machine learning is another area of focus, adding that if he could find 100 machine learning experts to hire he would “do it tomorrow”. Read: Capitec is targeting hires in these 3 areas
