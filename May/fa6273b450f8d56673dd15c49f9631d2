Residency and citizenship specialist Monarch&Co says that the Portuguese Golden Visa programme is the most popular European scheme for South Africans due to its investment options, minimal stay requirements, and travel and lifestyle benefits. And at €280,000 (R4.5 million), the cost makes it a compelling programme, the Sandton based firm said. At launch of the Portugal programme, the initial requirement was a real estate investment of €500,000 which allows a main applicant and their qualifying dependents to apply for Portuguese residency initially and citizenship after 5 years. The Portuguese government however, some time back, discounted the €500,000 threshold to €350,000 if real estate investments are located within areas of urban regeneration, were built more than 30 years ago and refurbishment works are planned to be executed. “This was again further discounted to €280,000 if the investment meets the above criteria and is situated in a low density area – regions with less than 100 inhabitants per square kilometre or with GDP per head less than 75% of the national average,” Monarch&Co said.
