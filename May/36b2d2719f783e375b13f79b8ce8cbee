Ford has launched its new Ranger Raptor in South Africa. The bakkie is equipped with Ford’s new 2.0-litre Bi-Turbo diesel engine that delivers a maximum of 157kW of power and 500Nm of torque. The engine offers both high performance and efficiency, thanks to its combination of a small high-pressure turbo and a large low-pressure turbo that work to provide optimal performance throughout the engine speed range, Ford said. Externally the Ranger Raptor boasts a 51 mm taller ride height, 283 mm ground clearance, 150mm wider front and rear track and 850 mm wading depth. The front fenders are made from durable composite materials for off-roading, while the bumper includes LED fog lamps with air-curtain ducts, which reduce air resistance. Ford said that the flared shape of the fenders has been designed to accommodate the long-travel suspension and BF Goodrich all-terrain tyres that were specifically developed for the Ranger Raptor. <img class="size-full wp-image-316970 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-2.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1199" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-2.jpg 1800w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-2-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-316972 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1199" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3.jpg 1800w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Internal features Ford said that the Ranger Raptor’s sports seats are uniquely designed and trimmed in technical suede for maximum grip, providing optimum support during high-performance off-road driving. The steering wheel features perforated leather hand grip sections, paired with lightweight magnesium paddle shifters for quick gear changes. Ford said that the Ranger Raptor is also loaded with safety and convenience features that make it suitable for both on and off-road driving. These features include: Ford’s standard Sync 3 with navigation system offers a unique “breadcrumb” feature to leave a trail in uncharted areas;
Ford Stability Control (FSC), which incorporates Roll Stability Control (RSC) that was specifically developed for Ford’s sport utility vehicle (SUV) range;
Position Sensitive Damping (PSD) shock absorbers exclusively manufactured by FOX for this model;
A Terrain Management System (TMS) which includes a Baja mode – inspired by Mexico’s famous Baja Desert Rally – which enables ultra-responsive, high-speed off-road performance. <img class="size-full wp-image-316976 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3.png" alt="" width="1251" height="781" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3.png 1251w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3-300x187.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3-768x479.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3-1024x639.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-3-1200x749.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-316978 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-4.png" alt="" width="1254" height="867" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-4.png 1254w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-4-300x207.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-4-768x531.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-4-1024x708.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ranger-Raptor-4-1200x830.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Pricing Pricing starts at R786,400 and comes standard with Ford Protect – comprising a four-year/120 000km comprehensive warranty, three-year/unlimited distance roadside assistance and five-year/unlimited km corrosion warranty.
