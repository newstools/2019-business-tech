In today’s technologically-advanced and competitive environments, organisations are faced with rapidly expanding applications portfolios, both in size and complexity. In addition to protecting legacy applications and certifying new releases of software developed in-house, it’s also critical to ensure the security of out-sourced and commercial off-the-shelf applications. To meet these needs, Security as a Service (SECaaS), inspired by the Software as a Service model, has gained a strong – and essential – foothold in the market. With SECaaS solutions, organizations can trust the security of their software, locate code vulnerabilities with ease and deploy security at the speed of DevOps. Most importantly, as time to market continues to be crucial for business, organizations are adopting DevOps or similar agile methodologies for rapid development. In fact, businesses believe that by 2020, each application will need to be released 30 additional times each year in order to keep up with the demands from customers and partners to interact with the organization through applications. Speed is of the essence. Businesses cannot afford for security issues and cyber risks to slow down the time it takes for new applications and updates to be released into the market.

SECaaS is a business model in which a service provider integrates their security services into a corporate infrastructure on a subscription basis. From a total cost of ownership perspective, this is far more cost effective than most individuals or corporations can provide on their own, largely because SECaaS solutions do not require on-premises hardware, avoiding substantial capital outlays. Cyber, Security and Information Heads want end-to-end application security solutions, with the flexibility of testing on-premises and on-demand to cover the entire software development lifecycle. SECaaS delivers on these needs. According to McKinsey, as software delivery has moved from multiyear releases to daily updates, software-development practices have evolved to focus on building high-quality software at an increasingly fast pace. DevOps is the next frontier in the evolution towards increasingly agile development methodologies, which naturally supports speed to market. In a DevOps model, engineers have extensive operational responsibilities to enable the release of production code. Companies need to master five core-competence areas to achieve DevOps at scale: Continuous integration and delivery.
Automated testing.
Self-service access to infrastructure.
Automated performance management.
Infrastructure that can scale automatically. <img class="size-full wp-image-318592 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Image-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Image-1.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Image-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This naturally impacts product security and risk management, because in order to build a secure product, security and risk-management thinking must be incorporated across the product-development life cycle. According to McKinsey, this implies that security transcends secure-coding practices. It includes involving a security champion in the DevOps team from inception, building a secure customer experience, and investing in tools and hackathons to identify security issues early in the development cycle. In fact, security is so important to the framework of DevOps that the team DevSecOps has been coined to emphasize the need to build a security foundation into DevOps initiatives. Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing 2019, states that DevSecOps, modern web application design and high-profile breaches are expanding the scope of the AST market. Security and risk management leaders will need to meet tighter deadlines and test more complex applications by accelerating efforts to integrate and automate AST in the software life cycle. This is difficult to do in-house – certainly at the speed and scale required – which naturally speaks to the benefits of cloud-based Security as a Service solutions. Download the white paper and find out how to secure your applications at the speed of DevOps Cloud-based SECaaS is essentially a security management model through which businesses outsource their network security to a third party, typically a cloud service provider. With this model, the cloud service provider assumes the security for the business, while the business pays a regular fee to the service provider for the security provided. There are several benefits gained by businesses using SECaaS rather than developing your own individual security framework. Setting up traditional security protocol typically requires the purchase of the necessary hardware and software, licenses for the use of security software, and hiring skilled cybersecurity professionals. In addition to these capital expenses, there are operational expenses involved in maintaining the security framework. These expenses can have a significant negative impact on a business’s profits. Businesses that invest in SECaaS, on the other hand, have little to no capital expenses. Instead, they pay a regular fee to the service provider for the use of the protection services. Not only is this fee less than the cost of implementing a traditional security framework, but it is a fixed monthly sum. In addition, there’s a reduction in complexity because organisations do not need to deploy multiple different security tools into the environment – an additional cost in itself. As the number of Virtual Machines (VMs) in an organization expands, contracts or moves between physical facilities and cloud providers, the business’s security level is maintained. SECaaS agents are generally configured to reach back to the ‘mothership’ on activation, which means your network enjoys the same, consistent security and coverage, no matter what changes are taking place internally. Network threats are constantly evolving as new innovative ways to compromise computer networks are developed. Frequent application and software updates are not only necessary to ensure that the network remains fully protected from new threats, they’re an operational imperative. SECaaS, particularly if the provider is following DevOps practices, ensures that businesses remain up-to-date in their security as the cloud service provider ensures that security updates are installed as soon as they are available. If a network is compromised by a virus or malicious software, time is of the essence. The longer it takes to identify and neutralise malware, the greater the damage to the network. Cloud-based security solutions ensure round-the-clock network monitoring, which means there are always experts available to respond to – and neutralize – network threats. There is a patent shortage of cybersecurity specialists who are able to develop and maintain security networks – not just in south African, but at a global level. According to Forbes, it’s estimated that by 2021, there will be at least 3,5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions. With a shortage of this magnitude, most businesses may be unable to hire cybersecurity specialists with the right set of skills to protect their networks. With SECaaS, however, businesses no longer have to worry about finding cybersecurity specialists; cloud service providers have cybersecurity experts on staff able to provide the necessary network security. More importantly, these skills are on-demand and able to be deployed across multiple businesses and networks. SECaaS solutions can also help to increase the skill sets of internal junior security administrators by providing a single pane of glass view of the security functions within the organization. Intuitive tools make it easier for a limited size and/or skilled staff to be more effective. <img class="size-full wp-image-318594 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Image-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Image-2.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Image-2-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Fortify offers end-to-end application security solutions with the flexibility of testing on-premises and on-demand to cover the entire software development lifecycle. Complete software security assurance with Fortify on Demand – our application security as a service – integrates static, dynamic and mobile AppSec testing with continuous monitoring for web apps in production, delivering security testing, vulnerability management, expertise, and support. Fortify on Demand makes it easy to create, supplement and expand a complete Software Security Assurance program, including SAST, DAST, MAST, IAST, RASP, continuous application monitoring and secure developer training. #1 Secure development Finding and fixing application security issues early, during development, is far less costly than waiting until after an application has been deployed. Fortify on Demand empowers developers to create secure software from inception, which is critical. Fully integrated within the IDE where developers work, static assessments provide immediate feedback to the developer. Open source component analysis can be added with a mouse click to avoid including known vulnerable components, and audited scan results, including line of code details and remediation advice, help drive secure coding best practices. As organizations further mature and adopt DevOps principles, Fortify on Demand static assessments are often integrated into the software toolchain as an automatic step in the continuous build and integration pipeline. #2 Security testing A dynamic or mobile assessment of the running application in a QA, test, staging or production environment simulates real-world hacking techniques and attacks employed by malware creators. For web applications and web services, dynamic assessments employ a combination of automated and manual testing techniques to crawl the application attack surface and identify exploitable vulnerabilities before an application release is deployed to production. Furthermore, interactive application security testing (IAST) with Fortify’s run-time agent supercharges dynamic testing to find more vulnerabilities — allowing them to be fixed faster. #3 Production monitoring Inevitably, not all vulnerabilities can be remediated for every application before it goes live. Misconfigurations in production environments can introduce issues not present in preproduction, and new zero-day vulnerabilities arise in-between release cycles. A robust production monitoring regimen includes continuous dynamic scanning for vulnerabilities and risk profile changes, discovery of rogue applications, and run-time detection of security events in the application itself. Fortify on Demand provides all production application monitoring activities in a single, integrated place.
