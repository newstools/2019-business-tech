Liberty Two Degrees (L2D) – with a property portfolio including Sandton City, Eastgate and Melrose Arch – has announced that it will appoint a ‘no plastic shopping bags’ policy across its malls by 1 January 2020. In a statement, the company said that it has partnered with an Alexandra community-based organisation called Bana Bags to introduce plastic free bags into its centres to ensure the continuation of education to encourage sustainable and environmentally friendly ways of doing business. It has also initiated the introduction of recycling drop-off booths in Sandton City and at Eastgate Shopping Centre and will be rolling this out throughout its portfolio. “With rising levels of plastic pollution in our country and oceans, it is no longer a case of best practice to eradicate the use of plastic shopping bags but rather a commitment of paramount importance and necessity,” said Amelia Beattie, chief executive of L2D. “We are committed to implementing this initiative to drive our sustainability imperative. “The policy will be effective 1 January 2020 and as a sector benchmark, we are keen to continue to transform the retail industry in an environmentally sustainable manner,” Beattie said.
