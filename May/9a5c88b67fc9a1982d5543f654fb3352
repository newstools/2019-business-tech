The new Range Rover Evoque has launched in South Africa. At launch, South African customers have a choice of a 132kW diesel and 183kW petrol engines, while a 221kW plug-in hybrid will be added to the range early in 2020. The diesel, badged D180, returns an average fuel consumption of 5.8l/100km and is capable of accelerating from 0-100km/h in 9.3 seconds. The P250-badged petrol returns a 7.4l/100km average fuel consumption and sprints from 0-100km/h in 7.5 seconds. Ground clearance is 212mm, while approach and departure angles are 25 degrees in the front and 30.6 degrees in the rear. <img class="size-full wp-image-317434 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="660" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-1-300x198.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-1-768x507.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-317436 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-2-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-317438 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="658" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-3-300x197.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-3-768x505.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Internal The latest Evoque comes with a variety of all-terrain technologies such as Hill Descent Control, Gradient Release Control and All-Terrain Progress Control. There is a reversing camera as standard on all models, alongside a suite of advanced driver assistance systems and active safety features such as Lane Keep Assist and Driver Condition Monitor. ClearSight Ground View – the realisation of Land Rover’s transparent bonnet concept previewed on the Discovery Vision concept – is a world first. Cameras in the front grille and on the door mirrors project a feed onto the central touchscreen to show what is ahead of and underneath the front of the vehicle with a virtual 180-degree view. For entertainment, new Range Rover Evoque features Land Rover’s Touch Pro Duo infotainment system, combining two sleek 10-inch high-definition glass touchscreens, a 12.3-inch driver display behind the steering wheel and full-colour head-up display. An InControl Remote smartphone application allows customers to stay in touch with their Evoque, no matter where in the world they are. Customers can use their phone to find their vehicle or check the remaining fuel range, lock and unlock the vehicle remotely, as well as pre-heat or cool the cabin to the desired temperature. Ranger Rover said that the Evoque is future-proofed, with wireless software updates to the infotainment and vehicle systems which means the compact luxury SUV continuously improves over time, without having to visit a retailer. <img class="size-full wp-image-317440 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-4-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-317442 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="670" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-5.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-5-300x201.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Evoque-5-768x515.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Pricing You can find pricing for all of the new Range Rover Evoque models below: Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 D 132kW D180 – R734,300 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 D 132kW D180 S – R784,300 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 D 132kW D180 SE – R843,800 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 D 132kW D180 R-Dynamic S – R813,000 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 D 132kW D180 R-Dynamic SE – R872,500 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 D 132kW D180 R-Dynamic HSE – R920,200 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 D 132kW D180 First Edition – R945,900 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 P 183kW P250 – R776,300 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 P 183kW P250 S – R826,300 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 P 183kW P250 SE – R885,800 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 P 183kW P250 R-Dynamic S – R855,000 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 P 183kW P250 R-Dynamic SE – R914,500 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 P 183kW P250 R-Dynamic HSE  – R962,300 Range Rover Evoque 5 Door 2.0 P 183kW P250 First Edition – R987,900 Read: The Ford Ranger Raptor – South African pricing
