FNB will now allow businesses to completely take up credit and investments via its mobile app. The product allows businesses with an annual turnover between R0 and R60 million to apply and get an overdraft, business loan and revolving loan, the bank said. “Historically, our business customers could only apply for credit via branches or online banking,” said Daniel Kaan, CEO of Business Core Banking at FNB Business. “Given that over 50% of all FNB Business credit is currently being digitally originated and approved, SMEs will now conveniently and seamlessly take up credit through a channel of their choice.” Kaan said that FNB offers a 48 Hour Notice Investment account for SMEs, which allows them to easily access their cash within a period of two days. “This account is predominately used to manage cash flow and operating expenses. Businesses can manage it on the app, with an option to reinvest or transfer interest to another account,” he said. How to apply FNB said that SMEs can take up credit or investments by following a few simple steps on the FNB App: Logging in and selecting Business Credit Solutions/Investments;
Opting for the preferred option;
Viewing the quote and accepting the agreement;
Businesses without an FNB Account will be offered the products during the application process. Read: Standard Bank launches new low cost account that rewards users with free mobile data
