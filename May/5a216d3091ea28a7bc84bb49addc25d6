South African motorists will soon be notified about speed traps through the Google Maps app. According to TechCrunch, the feature – which was already available in some territories – will allow Google Maps users to see speed limits, speed cameras and mobile speed cameras. It will also notify them of upcoming traffic traps. The current speed limit will now also in the bottom corner of the app, while speed traps show up as icons on the roads themselves. TechCrunch said that rollout is taking place on both Android and iOS. However, Android users will additionally be able to report mobile speed cameras and stationary cameras, while both iOS and Android users will be able to see those updates during their drive. A similar system has already been implemented by Google Maps competitor, Waze, which notifies users of the current speed limit as well as any potential speed traps. Google acquired Waze in 2013, but has been slow to implement some of the app’s most popular features. Read: Google will now auto-delete some user data
