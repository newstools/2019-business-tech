Analytics company, Lightstone, has released new data looking at the most valuable suburbs in South Africa. Lightstone’s analysis includes the data of nearly eight million registered properties across South Africa – 83% of which are residential properties and 17% non-residential. A total of 6.7 million residential properties were tracked, valued at R5.4 trillion – a figure which is heavily supported by the R2 trillion Gauteng market. Freehold properties remain the largest percentage of this figure with 67%; estates follow at 18.3% and sectional title with 14.2%. The group found that the Western Cape and Gauteng feature the larger proportion of properties and total value with more than 50% of the national market value captured in these two provinces. Lightstone said that the most valuable suburbs are also found in these provinces, including: Western Cape – Cape Town; Sea Point, Rondebosch and Fresnaye;
Gauteng – Bryanston, Morningside and Midstream; The one notable exception is Umhlanga in KZN which has seen significant investment over the last decade. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-314792" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Value-South-Africa.png" alt="" width="800" height="491" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Value-South-Africa.png 614w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Value-South-Africa-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Most valuable streets and suburbs in Cape Town Lightstone also published data looking at the most expensive streets and suburbs in Cape Town.
