It really is a powerhouse around the world,” he said. He said the company started in 1992 and has been growing and becoming more powerful ever since. The group has moved the narrative of buying insurance away from it being a grudge purchase, and more something you adopt to make your life easier and more beneficial through rewards. This would be the philosophy with the group’s bank as well, which is an “extra layer” to wrap around the company, Sampson said. In terms of brand value, Discovery ranks 94th in the overall top 100.
