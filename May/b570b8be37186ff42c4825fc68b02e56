Ride-hailing app inDriver has launched in Johannesburg – bringing added competition for Uber and Taxify. Launched in Cape Town earlier in the year, the app’s Real Time Deal (RTD) model allows passengers to set their own fare for their chosen route. Nearby drivers who receive notice of ride requests have three choices – accept the fare offered, ignore the offer or bargain for a higher price. In a statement on Thursday (16 May), inDriver said that 3,000 new drivers have already registered on the app. “We want to give the power of setting prices back into the hands of passengers and drivers by countering price surging used by other ride-hailing companies,” said inDriver spokesperson Rifqa Carr. “Passengers using the app pay on average 20-30% less than with other services. While pre-approved rates in the app are used to guide users – the final fare is set by the passenger and driver in a real-time negotiation,” she said. Carr said that the service is suited to longer commutes, and is the more affordable platform for passengers also benefits drivers, with 0% commission charged for the first few months. “Drivers have the freedom to choose whichever ride request they like, without any risk of being penalised. They’re also able to see the full fare, from point A to point B, and can then decide if they want to accept the request – or not,” she said. Read: Bankers play the blame game after disastrous Uber IPO
