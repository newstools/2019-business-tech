South Africa’s parliamentarians are set to be sworn in on 22 May 2019. Those MPs will then elect a new president for the country, who will be inaugurated on the following Saturday (25 May). The president will announce his new cabinet on 26 or 27 May, and the new ministers will be sworn on the 28th. While Ramaphosa, has already taken aim at corruption by sacking some compromised ministers and officials and empowering investigations, “much of his party still hasn’t gotten the message,” Bloomberg recently pointed out. Several high-profile malefactors have been re-elected to parliament. Ramaphosa needs to keep them out of his cabinet. He also needs to make sure that those responsible for engaging in past acts of corruption are held to account. “To that end, the president must ensure that the National Prosecuting Authority has the resources it needs,” Bloomberg said. It also said that the president should replace the Public Protector — “who has not lived up to the high standards set by her predecessor”. Ramaphosa must convince unions, staunch ANC backers, that there is more to be gained by expanding opportunity and competition than by maintaining the bloated payrolls of Eskom and other state-owned enterprises. “For too long, the ANC has corralled votes by effectively ring-fencing the privileges of the minority of South African workers with formal jobs. To provide the ANC’s promised “better life for all,” Ramaphosa should put his country before his party. If he does so, both may come out on top, Bloomberg said.
