A group of South African teenagers have assembled their own single-propeller plane, and now plan to fly the aircraft from Cape Town to Cairo, and back. The project is the brainchild of teen pilot, Megan Werner, who founded U-Dream Global to inspire her peers to follow their dreams. In 2018, U-Dream Global selected twenty inexperienced teenagers from various backgrounds across South Africa and provided them with hands-on experience in engineering and building an aircraft. The teens assembled a Sling-4 aircraft from start to finish within three weeks, under the guidance and supervision of a group of senior engineers in a highly controlled environment. Following final inspections and flight certifications, Megan and various teen co-pilots are now set to fly the light aircraft from Cape Town to Cairo and back in June â€“ visiting nine countries along the way. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-320338" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-1-e1559208033714.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-320346 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-3.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="960" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-3.jpg 960w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-3-50x50.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-320340 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-2.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-2.jpg 960w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-2-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-320358 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-4.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-4.jpg 960w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plane-4-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The team are considering a number of safety features, and plan to cross over Namibia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Ethiopia among other countries on their way to Cairo. While the group has already received some financial support, it has started a fundraising campaign to cover some of the additional costs. The fundraising drive aims to raise money to cater for logistics on the ground in the targeted African cities during the trip, the fuelling of the planes as well as any other project needs during the challenge. The trip is scheduled to start on the 12 June 2019 and is expected to take more than a month. Read: Pictures: SA Blood Service unveils its new delivery drone
