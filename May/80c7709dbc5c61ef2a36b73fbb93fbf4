Listed technology and telco firm Huge Group says it has agreed to acquire an interest in Pansmart, giving it control over an authorised distributor of Panasonic’s voice, video and CCTV products. “Pansmart is a strong challenger in the South African PABX market, having been granted a distribution licence by Panasonic in 2016. Since then, Pansmart has expanded the Panasonic market share significantly, with a full technical and sales competency, Huge said in a statement. “The hybrid PABXs that Pansmart distributes include embedded analogue voice ports which provide simple and cost effective PABX and GSM Voice solutions. Pansmart’s Panasonic PABX and Huge Telecom’s GSM-based Full Suite Telephony offering is a powerful connectivity combination.” Pansmart represents the second transaction of the year by Huge Group, and is in-line with the group’s strategy of expanding Huge Telecom’s real estate of customers and including a new brand offering to its portfolio of products. “Following Pansmart’s prior years of successful market expansion, the connection with Huge Group provides additional incentive for Pansmart to accelerate its channel growth by leveraging the synergy between its PABXs and the voice connectivity offering of Huge Telecom,” it said. The acquisition will take effect on 13 May 2019. Pansmart will retain its brand, but will incorporate its status as a member of Huge Group. Read: Huge Networks in merger with Otel
