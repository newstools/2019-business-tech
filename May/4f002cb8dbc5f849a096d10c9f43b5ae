Cell C says it has signed an agreement with the Free State Provincial Government, that paves the way for public access WiFi for the province. The proposed project will provide more South African citizens with faster and more reliable Internet access, especially those from previously disadvantaged communities. “We firmly believe that there is a positive correlation between the availability of internet access and the social and economic advancement of communities,” said Free State premier, Sisi Ntombela. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) sets out the way forward for Cell C’s public access Internet hotspots around the province supported by Facebook’s Express WiFi platform. Facebook Express Wi-Fi will help Cell C bring fast, affordable and reliable internet access to the Free State public and the MOA with the Province reflects the success of the project already running in other parts of the country. “We are pleased to be working with the Province in the first stages of this proposed project. Cell C’s aim is to bring as many South Africans as possible into the digital economy and give them every advantage through the technologies we can provide,” said Cell C CEO Douglas Craigie Stevenson.
