South Africans are buying books which focus on starting your own business, as the country battles with one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. According to the latest Stats SA Quarterly Labour Force Survey, South Africa ended 2019 with an unemployment rate of 27.1%. Compared to a year ago, employment and unemployment increased by 2.2% (358,000) and 4.4% (259,000) respectively, while the number of persons who were not economically active declined by 0.1% (9,000). However, new book sales statistics provided by Takealot show that South Africans are clearly trying to lift themselves up and create their own means of wealth – whether to fight unemployment or simply to get out from under a controlling boss. Popular topics include money management and ‘building your first R1 million’, with both local and international authors featuring on the bestsellers list. These include: Robert Kiyosaki;
Warren Ingram;
Marnus Broodryk;
Jason Lee;
Dale Carnegie;
Sam Beckbessinger. “The majority of book sales are currently linked to international authors,” Takealot said. “However, with the number of local authors on the rise, this picture will soon change as South African readers look for local solutions to uniquely South African situations.” Below it outlined 10 of the most popular business and finance books on its website right now.
