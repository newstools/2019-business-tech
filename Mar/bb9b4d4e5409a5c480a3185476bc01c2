If you are planning to move or invest outside South Africa, you should really consider Malta, an outlandish island, south of Italy, boasting of great weather, sandy beaches, an exceptional lifestyle, delicious food and low cost of living. With just under half a million inhabitants, the island offers an attractive standard of living, a stable economy, low crime rate, and excellent healthcare services, while its diverse and active social life caters for all ages – with many cultural events held throughout the year. Plus it also offers a very attractive residence and visa programme, ideal for South African nationals looking to invest in an offshore holiday or retirement place with residency and ease of movement across Europe. Here are the top reasons that make Malta so fabulous: Malta and its sister island Gozo, are surrounded by calm, tranquil water and bathed in warm, sunny weather nearly all year round. It enjoys some 3,000 hours of sunshine per year – one of the highest in Europe – and the summer season practically starts from end March up until end November. Winters are not that bad either, with temperatures averaging at 15 degrees Celsius at night. The 2018 edition of the United Nation’s World Risk Report has put Malta, once again, as the world’s second-safest country in terms of its exposure to and ability to cope with natural disasters. And when it comes to crime, a survey compiled by InterNations, the largest worldwide network for people living and working abroad, placed Malta in the fifth place out of 191 countries. Not bad at all! As per a recent study by Knight Frank, published by Bloomberg, Malta has a stable property market and offers steady capital growth, as it is the country with the highest residential property price gains in the world – surpassing Hong Kong. Looking at 2018, based on figures taken from Malta’s own Central Bank, home prices on the island rose some 17 per cent in the three months to June when compared to the same period in 2017. Read more. Maltese sea water is in the top three cleanest in Europe. Malta consistently ranks in the top positions for the cleanest bathing waters in the EU and has been given a star by the European Commission. Every single one of its 87 bathing sites reach EU standards and most of them have been given top marks and rated as excellent. Maltese waters are incredibly beautiful, featuring memorable shades of deep blue and turquoise. Malta offers various residency programmes ideal for foreign national (both EU and non-EU) looking for a great place for a second permanent residence. These continue to gain increased momentum and international reputation, thanks to the island’s efforts to only attract quality candidates. The administration fees are relatively low, access to the Schengen area is guaranteed and there are substantial tax savings available to applicants. Read more. Malta’s capital city, Valletta, was the European Capital of Culture 2018 and served as inspiration to other cities based on different cultural elements. Valletta is also a UNESCO World Heritage site since back in 1980 because of its wealth of cultural and historical features. The city was founded by the Order of St John of Jerusalem, but during its time it has been ruled by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Christians. Each of these ages have helped to shape Valletta into the city it is today and each have left remnants of their own stories behind in its architecture, culture, archaeology, food and influences. English is one of the two official languages and almost everyone there can speak English fluently. Another major benefit for South Africans looking to reside in Malta is that driving is on the same side of the road as South Africa. For South Africans interested in investing or moving to Malta or Gozo, Frank Salt Real Estate is hosting its next series of MOVE TO MALTA – investment, residency, and relocation seminars – free of charge. The upcoming seminars will consist of a few short presentations followed by one-on-one sessions with key speakers and their support teams, as well as Frank Salt partner agents in South Africa. The subjects covered will include real estate or investment opportunities and taxation and residence in Malta through presentations by Grahame Salt, a director of Frank Salt Real Estate, together with South African partners who have experienced Malta first hand. Lawyers and residency specialists from Maltese law firm EMD, and some of the island’s leading property developers will also be present. The individual sessions are highly recommended as they offer an opportunity to gather exact information related to property investment, taxation, or residency.
