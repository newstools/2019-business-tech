MTN customers can now top up airtime and data bundles through WhatsApp. Customers can also receive notifications and check their balances through the messaging service, rather than visiting a website or dialling a call centre. MTN said it plans to further expand the MTN Chat channel offering in the near future. This will see the inclusion of services such as customer support, the management of upgrades and customer accounts, receiving balance notifications, and the offering of customised deals. The operator said that it also hopes to incorporate other instant messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger at some point in the near future. How to sign up As with any new WhatsApp contact, customers need to save the MTN Chat number 083 123 0011 to their contacts and send MTN a message saying “hi”. Customers will be sent a link to opt-in and once they’ve opted in, they’ll be offered a menu from which to choose their preferred service. MTN said that security is a high priority and safety and confidentiality features have been built into MTN Chat to provide a secure means of communication. Customers interact with a single number that has a verification marker to mitigate fraud. Read: MTN to launch messenger service
