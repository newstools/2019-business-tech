The UK Home Office recently announced its updated visa fees for 2019. According to immigration consultants, Breytenbachs, there will be no fee increases for most visa applications when the new rates come into effect on 29 March. The exception are visitor visa applications which have seen a small increase of between 2 and 3%. These fee increases are fortunately not significant, Breytenbachs said. “For the visitor visa application for six months, the fee change is £2. The fee change for the visitor visa, valid for ten years is £24, bringing the new cost to £822.” With a number of other countries also announcing their visa fees for 2019, BusinessTech looked at the general costs when applying for a  short-term visa in 2019.

The Schengen visa allows access to all the 22 European Union member states as well as four members of the European Free Trade Association including France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Hungary and Sweden. A Schengen visa allows the holder to stay in the Schengen Territory for up to 90 days per six months; however, pricing differs slightly according to age and location. Since May 2008, the fee for a short stay Schengen visa (less than 90 days) is €60 (R972), while the fee for a long stay visa (more than 90 days) is €99 (R1,604). Children between the ages of 6 and below 12 years old pay €35 (R567). Read: South African airports to get new e-gates – here’s what you need to know
