A Gauteng resident received a big surprise after discovering that he had been blacklisted for failing to pay his e-tolls. According to a report by IOL, the motorist was applying for credit when it was discovered they had been blacklisted for owing R60,000 in e-toll fees. At least 25 additional e-toll defaulters have also been given default judgments with more on the way, as South African National Road Agency’s (Sanral) expected to use this method to recover billions of rand still owed in e-tolls. In a statement released by Outa this week, the civil society group confirmed that  Sanral was pushing ahead with its plan to obtain default judgements against motorists who do not pay their e-tolls. Default judgments arise when a debtor does not respond to or defend a summons. While a number of Gauteng motorists have chosen to simply ignore their e-toll bills in the past, Outa has warned that there can be severe consequences for motorists who have a default judgement granted against them. By obtaining default judgments for the non-payment of e-tolls, motorists’ credit ratings may be affected, which makes it more difficult to obtain credit facilities, Outa said. Rudie Heyneke, Outa’s Transport Portfolio manager, said it was important that motorists do not ignore any summonses that they receive. “If these are issued for unpaid e-tolls, they must act quickly,” he said. “They can contact Outa’s offices for guidance on how to address the matter. By not responding to a summons, motorists open themselves up to default judgments and further legal actions that arise from this. “It also important to note that the state is under no obligation to inform motorists once a default judgment has been made. “They may only find out the next time they apply for credit, such as when attempting to take out a home loan. This can have a disastrous financial impact on households.” Read: E-toll funding needs to come from the fuel levy: Outa
