Eskom has announced that stage 1 load shedding will be implemented from 11h00 until 23h00. This is due to plant breakdowns, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, it said. Stage 1 calls for 1000MW to be rotationally loadshed nationally at a given period. Loadshedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. The group encouraged people to visit the websites of their electricity providers for a list of which areas will be affected. This marks the first time in a few weeks that Eskom has had to implement rolling blackouts, with the last time being in mid February. There has been a lingering threat of load shedding, however, with the company warning that the power system has been under constant pressure. Customers are urged switch off all non-essential appliances in an effort to reduce pressure on the national grid. Read: Why Eskom was always doomed to fail
