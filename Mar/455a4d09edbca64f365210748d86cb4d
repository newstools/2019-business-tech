As of 1 April 2019, the official fees payable on South African patents, registered designs, and patent and design applications will be significantly increased for corporate entities. According to law firm ENSAfrica, there will be a separation between “corporate” entities and SMEs in terms of these fees. “The most significant official fee increase will be a once-off fee increase that will apply to the filing of new patent and design applications and to renewal fees,” it said. “In particular, in regard to the increase in renewal fees for patents and designs, the new official fee for corporate entities, which is payable annually, is a hefty increase compared with the current sliding scale of fees depending on the annuity due. “In addition, all other official fees will increase by 5% from 1 April 2019. The new fee structure also provides for all official fees to increase annually by 5%.” You can find the new fees detailed below: <img class="size-full wp-image-306274 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Patent.png" alt="" width="561" height="368" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Patent.png 561w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Patent-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 85vw, 561px" /> Read: 16 South African jobs that are in high demand right now
