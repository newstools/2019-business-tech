Drone-flying in South Africa is governed by the South African Civil Aviation Authority which has set out regulations for remotely piloted aircraft (RPAS). The regulations set out the requirements for flying a drone in the country, as well as the areas where you are prohibited from flying and the dangers of flying in certain zones. As per the regulations, the SACAA prohibits flying a Remotely Piloted Aircraft, or toy aircraft 50 metres or closer from: Any person or group of persons (like a sports field, road races, schools, social events, etc.)
