The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has officially approved a number of new coins for 2019. The coins commemorate the country’s 25 years as a Constitutional Democracy – displaying a number of notable locations and events such as the Constitutional Court and the first national elections in 1994. Some of these coins are collectors’ items with R500 and R50 coins being minted purely for commemorative purposes. However, the SARB has confirmed that a new R5 coin and a number of new R2 coins will also enter into circulation. The SARB issues commemorative circulation coins from time to time as part of its currency production function. These coins are issued to commemorate a person or an event that has had a significant impact on society. Such coins are always produced in large quantities and are made available and accessible to the public at face value. You can find more information on these coins and their designs below.
