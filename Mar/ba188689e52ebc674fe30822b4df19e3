Renowned motoring journalist, Malcolm Kinsey, has published a new report looking at the replacement part costs of South Africa’s car of the year finalists for 2019. The list of finalists includes: Porsche Cayenne
Lexus ES
Mitsubishi Pajero Sport
Mercedes Benz A Class
Nissan Micra
Volvo XC 40
Honda Civic Type R
Alfa Romeo Stelvio
Hyundai Kona
Suzuki Jimny
Suzuki Swift
Renault Duster The winners are expected to be announced in early April 2019. Prices are based on the middle of the range models of each vehicle which means there may be a variance in prices, Kinsey said. “For example, a headlight could range from halogen to multi-LED focusing. “Likewise, steel wheels or mag wheels could be fitted – so the prices submitted are middle of the range and for a guide only. Likewise, Suzuki Swift prices cannot be compared with an Alfa Stelvio or Porsche as they are completely different segments of the market,” Kinsey said. While all prices are retail and include VAT, Mercedes and Nissan are net prices.

The proposals drafted by the Comp Com are aimed at addressing anti-competitive practices in the car repairs and parts industry. The proposed code is expected to empower car owners with the right to repair or service their vehicles at a provider of their choice, without voiding their warranties. Below BusinessTech looked at some of the most notable price differences for various parts among the car of the year vehicles, which includes vehicles with a starting price of R160,900 through to the Porsche which starts at R1,142.000.
