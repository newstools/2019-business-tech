Property developer Abland, in partnership with Giflo and Nedbank, will construct a new mixed use skyscraper in the Mother City – The Rubik – which will include premium office space and luxury apartments. The building has been designed by architect firm dhk, and features a stacked glassed tower block which, as the name suggests, angulates at various points to represent cubes. According to Abland, the development will cost around R480 million to complete, with construction anticipated to commence around the middle of the year, and completion targeted for 2021. The Rubik will feature luxury apartments starting from R2.4 million, which will be sold by Dogon Group Properties, and will have penthouses with floor-to-ceiling windows, a 24-hour concierge security, underground parking and easy access to lifestyle features of Cape Town’s CBD. The development will also feature a sun deck with pool and rooftop entertainment area clubhouse facilities, as well as a restaurant and state-of-the-art security, it said. The development site is located on the corner of Riebeek and Loop Street in Cape Town’s CBD  The Rubik from Abnormal on Vimeo. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303398" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Location.png" alt="" width="950" height="533" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Location.png 950w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Location-300x168.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Location-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303404" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik.jpg 800w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303402" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-01.png" alt="" width="955" height="538" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-01.png 955w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-01-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-01-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303400" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-02.png" alt="" width="951" height="530" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-02.png 951w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-02-300x167.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-02-768x428.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303396" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-03.png" alt="" width="951" height="533" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-03.png 951w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-03-300x168.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Rubik-03-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-302142" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Rubik.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="1200" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Rubik.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Rubik-188x300.jpg 188w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/The-Rubik-640x1024.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Cape Town property owners could soon be paying higher rates and taxes
