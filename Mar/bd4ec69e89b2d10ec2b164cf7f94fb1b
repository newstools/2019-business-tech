FlySafair has announced that its passengers will now have the option to send their boarding passes straight to their phones via WhatsApp, once they’ve completed the check-in process. This will be especially beneficial to passengers who have not made the booking themselves or where passengers have supplied an incorrect contact number during the booking process. In addition, passengers who have made bookings for multiple passengers will have the option to send each boarding pass, individually, to each person’s phone, via WhatsApp. Customers can add this option on their Whatsapp. When checking-in online, customers will be presented with four boarding pass options: Print their boarding pass
Email their boarding pass
Download the boarding pass directly to their device
Send the boarding pass to a contact number of their choice, via WhatsApp The latter option can be selected by clicking on the WhatsApp icon. Read: FlySafair to enable inflight card payments
