Eskom says that stage 2 load shedding will continue all weekend, as the country’s grid remains under pressure. The latest round of rolling blackouts is due to a shortage of generation capacity from plant breakdowns, and the need to manage diesel and water resources, the power utility said. “The management of the diesel and water resources is essential to ensure that the impact of the potential stage of load shedding in the week ahead can be reduced,” it said. Things for next week do not look any better, with Eskom saying its system outlook for next week further indicates a high risk and that up to Stage 2 load shedding may be implemented until the middle of next week. Eskom is currently implementing Stage 2 rotational load shedding, which is likely to continue until 23h00. “Eskom regrets the inconvenience that this will cause. Regular updates on the status of the power system will be provided through all the media platforms and will include the relevant times that load shedding will be implemented on the day,” it said. Load shedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. “We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand.” Eskom customers can check their load shedding schedules on the Eskom website (loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or through the customer contact centre on 086 003 7566.
