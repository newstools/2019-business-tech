YouTube has announced the launch of YouTube Music in South Africa. The new music streaming service offers music videos, official albums, singles, remixes, live performances, and covers from YouTube. While fans can enjoy the new ad-supported version of YouTube Music for free, YouTube has also announced YouTube Music Premium, a paid membership that gives you background listening, downloads and an ad-free experience for R59.99 a month. For a limited time, listeners can get three months of YouTube Music Premium free – for R59.99 per month after, or R89.99 per month for a Family Plan. YouTube Music offers a number of features, said Google SA head of Marketing Asha Patel. “A home screen that dynamically adapts to provide recommendations based on what you’ve played before, where you are and what you’re doing. “Thousands of playlists across any genre, mood or activity. The hottest new music. And, no internet? No problem. Get YouTube Music Premium to listen ad-free, in the background and on-the-go with downloads.  Plus, your Offline Mixtape automatically downloads songs you love just in case you forgot to.” Smart Search is available in most languages, including indigenous South African languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa. The new YouTube Music app is available to download from the Play Store and App Store today or users can check out the web player at music.youtube.com and sign up for YouTube Premium at youtube.com/premium.
