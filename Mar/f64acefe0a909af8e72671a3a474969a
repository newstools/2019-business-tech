Military website, Global Firepower, has released its military strength ranking for 2019. More than 137 countries feature on the list, with the ranking utilising more than 55 different factors to determine a given nation’s PowerIndex. However, the ranking does not simply rely on the total number of weapons available to any one country but rather focuses on weapon diversity within the number totals to provide a better balance of firepower available. In addition, nuclear weapons are not recognised directly (but receive an indirect score bonus), while geographical factors, logistical flexibility, natural resources and local industry influence the rankings. The USA was named as the most powerful country in the world in 2019 with 1.28 million active military personnel, 13,398 aircraft, more than 6,200 tanks and a defence budget of $716 billion. In distant second place is Russia with 1 million active personnel, 4,000 aircraft, 21,932 tanks and a defence budget of $44 billion. China, India and France round out the top five. Note: Some vehicles can fall under multiple classifications.
