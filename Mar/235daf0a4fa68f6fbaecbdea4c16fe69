Huawei Cloud has started offering commercial services in South Africa. This makes Huawei the world’s first cloud service provider with an operational data centre in Africa, the company said in a statement on Tuesday (5 March). The company added that it is leasing a data centre in Johannesburg from a partner from where it is deploying localised public cloud services based on local industry policies, customer requirements and partner conditions. Like all Huawei Cloud data centres, the South African facility complies with Tier 3+ standards and uses Huawei’s high-performance chips and network devices to offer a better user experience, it said. Edward Deng, VP of Huawei Cloud Business Unit, said South Africa was one of the most diverse and promising emerging markets globally, with tremendous potential, and cloud services are expected to unleash the latent capacity and drive the growth in the country. “We are looking forward to Huawei Cloud’s innovative technologies and services, such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence assisting African governments, carriers, and enterprises in a variety of industries such as finance, energy, agriculture, to leapfrog to a fully-connected, intelligent era.” In addition to the Chinese mainland, Europe and Latin America regions, Huawei Cloud had unveiled regions in Hong Kong, Russia, Thailand and Singapore to date. By the end of 2018, 40 availability zones had been opened in 23 geographic regions, providing reliable cloud services to users. Huawei said it plans to gradually operate more data centres in Kenya, Nigeria and other countries in Africa to provide localised, safe and reliable services.
