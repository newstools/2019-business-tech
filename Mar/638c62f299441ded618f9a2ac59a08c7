Short-term insurer Santam has announced the acquisition of Vantage Insurance Acceptances, an Underwriting Manager (UMA) with specialist underwriting skills and claims management of executive and classic cars. Vantage started operations as a registered Financial Services Provider (FSP) and UMA in 2009, and distribution is done through a network of independent brokers. Edward Gibbens, executive head: commercial and personal at Santam, said: “Vantage has grown consistently throughout its history, primarily because of its ability to maintain long-term relationships with the broker network supporting the company. We look forward to developing this business relationship with the Vantage team.” “With the direct support of Santam and the availability of many more resources to Vantage, it will further enhance our service abilities to this select market. Santam also provides excellent financial strength and surety where the protection of high valued assets is a priority need for the executive client,” said Adriaan Louw, CEO of Vantage.
