AutoTrader has published a list of the most searched-for budget cars in South Africa, with the Volkswagen Polo taking top spot – due mostly to churn, being the best-selling passenger vehicle in the country. “We analysed search data on AutoTrader for the period April to December 2018 and, unsurprisingly, the Polo reigns supreme,” said AutoTrader CEO George Mienie. “This should be expected; the Polo, now in its sixth generation, has attained near iconic status in South Africa. “While it is smaller than its sibling, the Golf, the Polo offers similar ride quality, great styling in and out, and an attractive price tag,” he said. The second most popular budget car is the Hyundai i10, followed closely by the Kia Picanto. The Ford Figo is the fourth most popular budget car in South Africa, followed by the Toyota Etios. The Figo was refreshed last year, while the Etios comes with the reliability and peace of mind that is associated with the Toyota brand. The two 2019 AutoTrader Car of the Year finalists – the Suzuki Swift and Nissan Micra – are almost neck-and-neck in sixth and seventh position, Mienie said. “They are both competing in the all-new Urban Compact Car of the Year Category. The Suzuki Swift and Nissan Micra will be put through their paces on March 11 and 12, when the highly qualified jury members subject these vehicles to intensive testing.” The Honda Brio, Renault Kwid and Datsun Go round off the top 10. “These are also extremely popular budget cars, with the Kwid and Go featuring especially attractive price tags,” Mienie said.
