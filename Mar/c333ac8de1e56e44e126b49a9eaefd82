Johannesburg Water has warned that continued load shedding is likely to have an impact on the city’s water supply. In a statement released on Monday (18 March), the organisation said it was important for residents to be aware of their load shedding schedules and to make the appropriate arrangements. “Johannesburg Water would like to advise residents of the City of Johannesburg to check load shedding schedule for their respective arrears on the Eskom and City Power websites as water supply does get affected by power outages,” it said. “In the event of load shedding for the duration of four hours and more, pockets of areas will have water shortages or even low pressure because Johannesburg Water uses electricity to pump water from the reservoir into the towers. “Residents are urged to make arrangements by ensuring they have water to last the duration of the outage when they are affected by load shedding.” The water provider added that this does not have enough water tankers to be able to assist as a form of alternative supply because of the size of areas that get affected by load shedding. South Africa faced its fifth consecutive day of power cuts on Monday, with Eskom warning that it plans to continue with load shedding until Wednesday. Through the course of the weekend, the power utility scaled up its load shedding schedule from Stage 2 up to Stage 4. Stage 4 load shedding will continue on Monday, 18 March until 23h00, Eskom said.
