While some generating units have returned to service, there is a risk of load shedding on Friday. “The power system, however, remains tight and vulnerable and while Eskom is making every effort to limit load shedding, it could be implemented at short notice should there be a shift in plant performance,” said the utility. Load shedding can also be included if there is a significant loss in generating plants due to unplanned technical breakdowns. The power utility said load shedding will only be implemented if absolutely necessary. Eskom urged residents and business to use electricity sparingly while also advising them to check their load shedding schedules on the Eskom or municipal website, and plan on the assumption that load shedding will take place. On Thursday, the power utility was granted allowable revenue of R206.380 billion in 2019/20, R221.843 billion for financial year 2020/21 and R233.078 billon for financial year 2021/22 from the National Energy Regulator SA (Nersa). This is in terms of its Multi-Year Price Determination (MYPD) 4 application, which Eskom brought to the regulator in September 2018. Friday’s probability of load shedding follows on the regulator’s decision to grant Eskom tariff increases of 9.41% in the 2019/20 financial year, 8.10% and 5.22% respectively over the three-year period. The utility had applied for a total balance of R219.6 billion for the duration of three years. For the 2019/20 year, Eskom applied for R219 billion, R252 billion for 202/21 and R291 billion for 2021/22. Eskom had also applied for a Regulatory Clearing Account (RCA) Year 5 (2017/18) balance of R21.6 billion. The regulator approved a RCA balance of R3.869 billion, which will be recoverable from standard tariff customers, local Special Pricing Arrangement (SAPs) customers and international customers.
