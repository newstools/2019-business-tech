Samsung Pay has already generated 400,000 purchase transactions since launching in South Africa in August 2018. This success was achieved through strong partnerships with banking institutions including Absa and Standard Bank, Samsung said in a statement on Monday (11 March). It added that the service was recently expanded to FNB and RMB Private Bank, and will be made available to Investec and Discovery Bank customers soon. “We’re excited to offer this innovative technology to more South Africans and are confident that the nation will continue to embrace the convenience of Samsung Pay with great enthusiasm,” said Justin Hume, director of Integrated Mobility at Samsung South Africa.
