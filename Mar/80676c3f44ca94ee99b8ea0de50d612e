The company said the new phone, called the Galaxy Fold, will be available towards the end of April . “Part smartphone, part tablet, Samsung’s category-defying Galaxy Fold offers users an entirely new kind of mobile experience, featuring fun and innovative ways to multitask, watch videos, play games, and more,” Samsung said. In a blog post on the company’s website, Samsung shows how it subjected the device to several rounds of extensive tests in its state-of-the-art reliability labs to demonstrate its readiness for market. “Naturally, given the smartphone’s design, a folding test was a pivotal part of the Galaxy Fold’s durability assessment,” Samsung said. The test, which examined whether the Galaxy Fold can outlast 200,000 folds and unfolds (or around five years of use, if used 100 times a day), took a full week to complete. “While the extent of the test may seem like overkill to some, Samsung viewed it as vital to ensuring the durability of device’s hinged design and Infinity Flex Display, it said. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Read: Samsung launches most extensive new lineup of smartphones
