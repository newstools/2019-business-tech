South Africa is struggling to contain the rising levels of substance abuse, with Dr Eugene Allers, a member of the South African Society of Psychiatrists (Sasop) believing that as many as 10 million South Africans abuse substances – led by alcohol, and followed by opioids like codeine, heroine, nyaope and wonga, and dagga. Allers told Cape Talk that obtaining drugs is easy in South Africa. “There are 10 million South Africans abusing substances and you don’t find 10 million people in rehabs. There’s a large proportion of people that don’t do anything about it, don’t recognise the problem and continue doing the problem,” said Allers. White River Manor Wellness Centre is an executive substance treatment centre located in White River, just north of Nelspruit in Mpumalanga. Founded in 2015, the facility treats men and women coping with substance abuse and co-occurring disorders, and utilises a collaborative program that is tailored to each person’s unique needs. “The recovery process is more successful when the programme is tailored to meet the specific needs of the client. For this reason White River Manor customises individual programmes for client that range from 28 days to 120 days. “At White River Manor we believe in finding a healthy balance between all areas in life. Our holistic approach to recovery takes every element of the client’s life into consideration,” it said. The group says that its staff component is made of specialist in the field of addiction. “We have a dynamic team of professionals consisting of Clinical Psychologists, Counselling Psychologists, Psychiatrists, CBT Expert, Behavioural Specialist, Art Counsellor, Addiction Specialists and Music Therapist. “Our management team has decades of experience in the field of addiction and therapeutic intervention.
