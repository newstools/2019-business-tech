The University of Johannesburg (UJ) has introduced a new online system that will enable its graduates to access their qualifications digitally. The online system has been introduced because of a need to increase security features related to the certification processes in order to prevent fraud, curb counterfeiting and to avoid fraudulent representation of awarded qualifications, the university said. “Not only does this online system offers graduates access to their awarded certification credentials securely and electronically, but it also gives the graduates access to share their qualification credentials for verification purposes with third parties or prospective employers, at no cost to both parties,” said the director of Central Academic Administration at UJ, Dr Tinus van Zyl. “The Digital Certificate system gives our alumni access to and put them in control of who can verify their qualifications. “Key features incorporated into the new system are designed around international security standards and are compliant with legislation in terms of the protection to personal information. “Once a third party or a prospective employer request to verify an awarded qualification, the certificate holder must authorise the access. UJ is constantly reviewing and implementing secure technologies to bring our clients the latest, cutting-edge systems and certification security features,” said Van Zyl. Key features that the system will offer include: The ordering of lost or damaged certificates;
The requesting of academic records or transcript supplements;
A secure online payment portal;
An optional delivery by courier (nationally or internationally);
The validation of awarded qualifications. Read: These are the best online MBAs to study
