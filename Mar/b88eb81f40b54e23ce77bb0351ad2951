The most exclusive mansions in the country are located in Cape Town, most notably in Clifton, Bantry Bay and Fresnaye on the Atlantic Seaboard where prices have reached upwards of R275 million. The Atlantic Seaboard is also home to the most exclusive street in the country, Nettleton Road in Clifton, where you can expect to pay upwards of R150 million for a home. “You can also find a few mansions in the Franschhoek area, especially in some of the exclusive vineyard estates such as Fransche Hoek Estate, Domaine des Anges and Sante Winelands Estate as well as Val de Vie in Paarl,” said Samuel Seeff, chairman of the Seeff Property Group. “Here you can expect to pay around R8 million – R38 million for a top end property. “These generally come with large homes and big plots overlooking vineyards and with stunning scenic vistas,” he said. Waterkloof in Pretoria East, and Sandton in Gauteng, are also among the most enviable addresses in the country, while Kwazulu Natal has the luxurious Zimbali Estate, located in Ballito. According to Seeff, the buyer profile of these mansion properties tends to be mixed, ranging from business executives and entrepreneurs to foreign embassies and consulates in the case of Bishopscourt and Constantia Upper. Foreign ‘swallow’ buyers are also attracted to these top end properties given the good value that they represent in dollar and euro terms, especially coastal and vineyard properties, he said. Seef outlined 5 extraordinary mansions for sale in Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg right now, and what you get for the asking price. Constantia Upper (Cape Town) – R69 million Mintaka Estate has its own private vineyard, and is situated on 25,000sqm of land (three title deeds with development opportunity). It includes a large homestead, guest cottages, caretaker’s house, staff accommodation, large swimming pool and splash pool with changing rooms, storage and garages and magnificent gardens with lawns, wooded enclaves, a Zen garden, rose garden, orchard, kitchen garden, vegetable patch, cascading ponds, and its own putting green. <img class="size-full wp-image-303482 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-1.png" alt="" width="679" height="556" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-1.png 679w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-1-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-303484 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-2.png" alt="" width="842" height="549" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-2.png 842w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-2-300x196.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-2-768x501.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-303486 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-3.png" alt="" width="741" height="552" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-3.png 741w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-3-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-303488 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-4.png" alt="" width="745" height="558" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-4.png 745w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-4-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-303490 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-5.png" alt="" width="744" height="552" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-5.png 744w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Constantia-5-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Zimbali (Ballito) – R70 million This home in Zimbali offers unrestricted 180-degree sea views.
