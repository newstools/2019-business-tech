The combination offers unprecedented freedom: personal door-to-door flying mobility,” said Mike Stekelenburg, chief engineer at PAL-V. “The gyroplane principle not only provides us with a safe and easy-to-operate flying car but it also enables us to make it compact and within existing regulations, which is the most important factor to build a useable flying car,” he said. 90 units will be produced and delivery will start in 2020. <img class="size-full wp-image-303744 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V-2.png" alt="" width="1048" height="623" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V-2.png 1048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V-2-300x178.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V-2-768x457.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V-2-1024x609.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-303746 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-v-3.png" alt="" width="968" height="627" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-v-3.png 968w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-v-3-300x194.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-v-3-768x497.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-303748 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V.png" alt="" width="995" height="619" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V.png 995w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V-300x187.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pal-V-768x478.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Koenigsegg – Jesko Koenigsegg unveiled its new supercar – the Jesko.
