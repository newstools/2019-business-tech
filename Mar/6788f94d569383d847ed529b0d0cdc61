Low-cost airline, Kulula.com says it has launched an application for iPhone and Android, while refreshing the look and feel of the airline’s digital offerings. The app was developed in partnership with Nacelle and Infinea Software Labs, which has recently been announced as a technology venture by Comair as part of the JSE listed company’s diversification strategy. “The aviation industry is forcing players to find enhanced ways of growing and maintaining their customer base and with this in mind, we developed our flagship public product to deliver kulula passengers with a more seamless travel experience,” ssaid Amanda Mocellin, CEO of Nacelle. “Our goal is to redefine the digital mobile airline space in South Africa in a uniquely kulula-way, whilst staying true to our core brand values of being fun, easy and witty. It is our hope that this will add value to our travel experience and deepen the relationship that we have with our loyal fans,” said Shaun Pozyn, head of marketing at Kulula.com. The airline’s new iPhone and Android application is still in its first phase, which will currently provide fans on-the-go ease of check-in, seat selection, flight status and an opportunity to manage their booking, add flight extras and more. As a second phase users can look forward to application enhancements, such as flight bookings, geo-location and push notifications to help customers stay informed about important real-time travel information, car rental bookings and sharing on social media platforms, such as Facebook. The new kulula.com application is available for download via the Apple App Store or Google Playstore. Read: Kulula.com to go cashless on flights
