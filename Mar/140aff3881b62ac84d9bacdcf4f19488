Bloomberg has updated its Billionaires Index for March 2019. Unsurprisingly the list is dominated by Americans, with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos ($138 billion), Microsoft’s Bill Gates ($98.5 billion) and Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffet ($83.6 billion) named as the three wealthiest people in the world right now. In comparison, there are just six Africans ranked among the world’s 500 richest people, while China which has a population that rivals the African continent, boasts 44 billionaires on the list. Aliko Dangote’s $17 billion net worth makes the Nigerian the richest person in Africa. Dangote is among just a few Nigerian billionaires, most of whom accrued their wealth by coming into possession of lucrative oil blocks or, in the case of telecom magnate Mike Adenuga, providing services to a fast-growing population. Egyptian brothers Nassef and Naguib Sawiris also feature on the list with a net worth of $6.79 billion and $5.04 billion respectively. South African billionaires The remaining three African billionaires that feature on the list are all South African. The country’s three wealthiest citizens – De Beers heir Nicky Oppenheimer, luxury tycoon Johann Rupert and property and wholesaling mogul Natie Kirsh – are worth a combined $20 billion. All three have extensive holdings outside Africa.
