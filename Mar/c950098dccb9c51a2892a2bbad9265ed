Spotify has exceeded expectations since launching in South Africa in March 2018. Claudius Boller, MD of Spotify Middle East & Africa, said that the streaming platform has seen significant traction, with a large number of local users opting to stay on the service after trying it for the first time. This has been driven by the launch of a number of new features such as the low-data saver option, the daily mix feature and the launch of South African charts, he said. Boller said that service has also been well received by the local music community, with the service regularly engaging with local artists and forming partnerships with events such as Oppikoppi and Ultra. “We have around 2,000 software and 400 hardware partnerships in the country right now,” Boller said. “While many of these are automotive partnerships we also have partnerships in place with Google maps, Sonos and Samsung – with more coming soon,” he said. “We have had a fantastic first year in South Africa, and want to thank all of the artists, labels and music fans who have been on the journey with us so far. We are very excited about what the future holds.” Below Spotify outlined some of the most popular artists and songs in its first year in South Africa.
