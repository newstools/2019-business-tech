The Financial Times has published its Online MBA ranking for 2019, showing a big jump in salaries for graduates of these courses over the past year. Warwick Business School remains the top-ranked programme, due to the strength of its faculty, its value for money and its graduates’ career progression, the FT said. “The key factors that decide the top 10 online MBAs are the career progress of alumni, the diversity of the cohort and the quality of online delivery. “The two main criteria for career progress, as for the FT’s global MBA ranking, are alumni salaries three years after graduation and the percentage rise in salary,” it said. The average salary across all online courses ranked stands at $148,742. “This is not far off the $189,975 average for the top 10 full-time MBAs in the 2019 global ranking,” the FT said. “Warwick Business School’s alumni salary for their online MBA is particularly strong. “Its online graduates earn $214,141 on average, compared with $118,406 for its full-time MBA ranking. This is partly due to the school’s strong reputation, but also because students on its online course tend to be older, have enjoyed more career progression and earn more than their full-time peers.” In South Africa, Milpark Education recently achieved international accreditation for its contact and online MBA from the Association of MBAs (AMBA). This is the only AMBA accredited online MBA in Africa and is the only African MBA with international accreditation for both contact and online distance learning, the group said. The estimated cost of the distance learning programme is R244,633, with the first year costing R107,260 and the second year coming to R112,910. However, as a celebration of the accreditation, the group said that it is offering a 10% discount on the fees, with the full price for the MBA now at R220,170 for both years.
