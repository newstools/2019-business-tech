Veldskoen has announced its public launch in the US – backed by investor Mark Cuban and his partners, Angela and Steve Watts. Cuban, with an estimated net worth of $4.1 billion, is a well-known startup investor and is a judge on the US Shark Tank show. The Watts’ originally partnered with Mark Cuban after they appeared on Shark Tank with their company, Slyde Handboards. After that success, the Watts’ wanted to expand with other authentic and moving products with Steve Watts, originally from South Africa, looking to the classic Veldskoen as the next big thing. “The history behind Veldskoen is unparalleled to any shoe in the world,” said Watts. “We have a brand philosophy centred on style, optimism and migration, so we only use naturally sourced materials, and make the shoes in South African certified fair labor and safety factories so the resulting product – Veldskoen – is incredibly comfortable in every sense of the word. “They are as perfectly suited for the office as they are for the pub or travelling around the world with flair.” The shoes are available on the company’s website and are sold in South Africa and the UK. They are available in a range of colours for both men and women. Read: Naspers to list new group in Amsterdam and on the JSE
