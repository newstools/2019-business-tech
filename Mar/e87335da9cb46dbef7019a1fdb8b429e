A July 2018 Eighty20 report found that the average South African consumer is subscribed to as many as nine different rewards programmes, covering retail, petrol, and banking, among other sectors. However, the report found that while South African consumers were highly subscribed, they aren’t necessarily always active when it came to using rewards programmes. Two standouts in this area are Pick n Pay’s Smart Shopper programme and Woolworths’ WRewards were however, shown to have the highest percentage of active users at 85% and 81% respectively. Below BusinessTech looked at what makes these programmes stand out, and how they compare against each other.
