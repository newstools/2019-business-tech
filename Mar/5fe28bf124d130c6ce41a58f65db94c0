BusinessTech has launched its inaugural Banking Survey, and would like your feedback. The survey takes less than two minutes to complete, and you stand a chance to win very cool prizes. Your feedback will provide valuable insight into South Africa’s bankings sector. The country’s retail banking space is set to be disrupted by new digital entrants, following the recent launch of TymeBank, which offers accounts with no monthly fees attached. At least three additional digital banks will also be making their way to market, with the launch of Discovery Bank planned for the end of March, and Bank Zero and Hello Paisa set to follow suit. The country’s established banks – the big five, including Absa, Capitec, FNB, Nedbank and Standard Bank – will be looking at new ways to meet the competition head-on.
