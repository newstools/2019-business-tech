Bidvest has appointed Mpumi Madisa as chief executive – designate. “This is consistent with a comprehensive succession plan that was developed and has been executed over the past several years to specifically mentor and continue her preparation for the CE role,” it said in a statement on Monday (4 March). Lindsay Ralphs will continue as the group chief executive until the 2021 financial year, and Madisa will work closely with Lindsay to ensure a smooth transition. Madisa first joined Bidvest in 2003 and has held several key and strategic leadership roles at subsidiary, divisional and Group level. Madisa is an executive director on the Bidvest Group board and holds other external non-executive director roles, including at Adcock Ingram and Business Leadership SA. “I am delighted that Mpumi has accepted this role. One of our key priorities is developing the next generation of leaders and Mpumi is the perfect example of this. Her exceptional leadership skills and depth of experience will ensure continuity for all Bidvest stakeholders and the Bidvest family,” said Ralphs.
