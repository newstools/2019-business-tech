Nedbank has announced that it will incorporate a new virtual assistant into its banking app. HeyNed, a digital virtual personal assistant and concierge service, uses a vast network of more than 350,000 product and service providers – linking app users to virtually anything they need, the bank said. It added that HeyNed customers will benefit as the digital service will negotiate better prices on their behalf. According to Ciko Thomas, group managing executive at Nedbank Retail and Business Banking, the service can be used to source items and access a host of value-adding services including restaurant and movie reservations, arranging transport home from school for your kids, and finding a recommended supplier for those home repairs and maintenance. Thomas said that Nedbank would also be introducing a Home-Buying Toolkit to its banking app. “For most people, a home is likely to be the biggest, most expensive purchase they will ever make which is why Nedbank has created this feature-rich toolkit to make sure they are equipped with all the information and insights they need to optimise the home buying experience and unlock maximum value for new homeowners,” he said. Among other features, the toolkit includes in principle home loan pre-approval that gives buyers a good idea of the amount they qualify for, as well as three free property reports, with information on estimated property valuation, average prices, demographics and amenities in the areas they are considering. “Once they have purchased their new home, the HeyNed feature will make it much easier for homeowners to manage the admin associated with moving into a home, such as managing municipal connections, furniture removals, renovations and security to mention a few,” Thomas said.
