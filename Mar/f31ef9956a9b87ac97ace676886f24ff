Open-access fibre infrastructure and connectivity provider, Dark Fibre Africa (DFA) has opened its office in Harare, Zimbabwe, marking its first network expansion into African markets outside of South Africa. The DFA Zimbabwe operations are headed up by Simon Chimutsotso, a seasoned executive with experience in rolling out telecommunications infrastructure in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and South Africa. An accomplished executive team will support him in planning and deploying the initial sections of the high-speed Zimbabwean network, which will be made available on a wholesale open-access commercial offering, DFA said. “Our entry into Zimbabwe is in line with our strategic intent of expanding into sub-Saharan and other African markets,” said Vino Govender, executive for strategy, mergers and acquisition, and innovation at DFA in South Africa. Chimutsotso said that his team has spent the past few months working on feasibility and compliance readiness. “We now stand primed to deliver a reliable and cost-efficient open-access network and high-quality service, which underlines the DFA customer-centric values.” “We are excited to build our customer base in this new territory and at the investment opportunity and value to be derived by the telecommunications sector of Zimbabwe and the economy at large,” Chimutsotso said.
