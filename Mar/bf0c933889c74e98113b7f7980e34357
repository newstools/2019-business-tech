FNB and RMB Private Bank customers who own a compatible Samsung smart device can now use Samsung Pay to make contactless payments at almost any payment terminal in South Africa. “Samsung Pay is the latest partner wallet to be enabled by FNB, following last year’s successful launch of both Garmin Pay and Fitbit Pay,” said Raj Makanjee, FNB Retail CEO. “In addition, FNB remains the only bank in Africa to allow customers to make contactless payments via any compatible Android smartphone, using FNB Pay on the FNB App.” FNB customers can download the Samsung Pay App from the Google Play store, register or login if they already have a profile, scan their cheque or credit (FNB Business Credit Cards excluded) cards with the camera, select the preferred method of authentication and verify the details to begin making payments. The bank said that Samsung Pay can be used on the following devices: Galaxy S10+, S10, S10e;
Galaxy Note 9, Note 8;
S9/S9+, S8/S8+, S7/S7 edge;
A8 (2018), A7 (2017) and A5 (2017);
Galaxy Watch, Gear S3 Watch and Gear Sport Watch. Read: Vitality Money will be a ‘game changer’ for Discovery Bank
