Land Rover has announced that its new Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, featuring plug-in hybrid (PHEV) drivetrain options, are now available in South Africa. Both models are badged P400e in reference to their respective power outputs of 404PS (297kW), and both combine a 221kW 2.0-litre four-cylinder Ingenium petrol engine with an 85kW electric motor. Each model’s 2.0-litre petrol engine is longitudinally mounted, with an 85kW electric motor housed within the ZF automatic eight-speed transmission at the centre of the vehicle, alongside a 7kW onboard charger. The access point for the charging cable is hidden at the front behind the grille badge of each vehicle, while the prismatic cell lithium-ion batteries are mounted at the rear beneath the boot floor. When rapid charging the 13.1kWh high-voltage lithium-ion batteries, full charges can be achieved in as little as 2 hours 45 minutes at home using an optional 32 amp wall box. The batteries can be fully charged in 7 hours 30 minutes using the 10 amp home charging cable supplied as standard. Range Rover PHEV – from R2,207,300 The Range Rover P400e can accelerate from 0-100km/h in 6.8 seconds and on to a maximum speed of 220km/h. It is available in both standard and long wheelbase body styles and has also been enhanced with further technologies for greater comfort and convenience. These include: Gesture sunblind: opened and closed by an advanced gesture control system that senses an occupant’s hand movement. All it takes to open the blind is a rearward swipe in front of the rear-view mirror, and forwards to close;
Air Cabin Ionisation: uses nano-sized charged water particles to cleanse and purify the air for enhanced passenger wellbeing;
Pixel-laser LED headlights: advanced technology is brighter and yet intelligently blanks sections of LEDs to avoid dazzling oncoming drivers;
Activity key: customers can securely lock and unlock their vehicle without the need to carry a conventional key fob. The front seats feature either 20 or 24-way movement thanks to the new seat frames, with wider and deeper foams as well as heated armrests. For additional convenience and personalisation, all seat functionality can be controlled via a smartphone app, whether inside or outside the vehicle. If you’re working while being driven, up to 17 connection points including domestic plug sockets, USB, and 12-volt are all available. The cabin is also tailored for relaxation with luxurious seats offering 25 massage programmes thanks to Hot Stone massage technology within the seat backs. For entertainment, the Range Rover P400e features Touch Pro Duo, which combines two high-definition 10-inch touchscreens on the centre console. Information can be swiped from one screen to the other, making the layout highly intuitive and engaging to operate. <img class="size-full wp-image-304970 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-1-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-1-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-304972 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-2-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-2-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-2-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-304974 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-3-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-3-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-3-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-304976 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-4-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-4-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Range-Rover-4-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Range Rover Sport PHEV – from R1,639,300 The Range Rover Sport also achieves a top speed of 220km/h, but accelerates from 0-100km/h in a slightly quicker 6.7 seconds. The introduction of the Jaguar Land Rover Activity Key also brings new levels of convenience to the Range Rover Sport, allowing customers to lock and unlock their vehicle without the need to carry a key fob – ideal for outdoor pursuits. Similarly to the flagship Range Rover, the Range Rover Sport also features the latest Touch Pro Duo infotainment system, gesture sunblind and Ppxel-laser LED headlights, but adds a new Advanced Tow Assist function to take care of the difficult counter-steering required to position trailers accurately when reversing. <img class="size-full wp-image-304978 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-304980 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-304982 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sport-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Jaguar I-Pace is now in South Africa – with a 470km charge range
