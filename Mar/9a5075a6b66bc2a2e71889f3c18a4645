Jaguar has launched its first all-electric vehicle (EV), the I-Pace in South Africa, which it says includes a rapid public charging network. The Jaguar I-Pace was on Tuesday (5 March) voted “Car of the Year” at the European Car of the Year Awards 2019. With a range of up to 470km from a single charge, the new Jaguar I-Pace offers a viable emissions-free solution to drivers who commute regularly but also enjoy longer journeys. A 90kWh Lithium-ion battery using 432 pouch cells can be topped-up with a range of flexible charging types including 7.4kW wall box units installed in homes as well as public chargers along the Jaguar Powerway – a network of rapid chargers placed at various points of convenience such as shopping centres nationwide, along common inter-city routes and at every Jaguar Land Rover dealership in South Africa.

Beyond this overnight charging habit, the Jaguar Powerway supports charging for long trips. We are already at the point where an electric car can be your everyday car,” said Brian Hastie, electrification team leader, Jaguar Land Rover South Africa and sub-Sahara Africa. Every I-Pace comes standard with a universal “occasional use” charging cable compatible with regular household sockets. This method will achieve a 0-100% charge in around 24 hours. Optional 7.4kW wall box home charger installations priced from R25,000 will achieve the same result in around 12 hours, ideal for overnight charging, it said. Rapid public charging times will depend on respective charger capacities, but the most prevalent (in South Africa) 60kW types will charge an I-Pace from 0-80% in a maximum 72 minutes and add 100km range in 20 minutes. The I-Pace is capable of accepting a charge capacity up to 100kW, which would enable 0-80% charges in under 40 minutes. “It’s important to note that charging habits will differ greatly to refilling conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, meaning refilling should happen whenever possible, such as every night at home. Refilling ICE vehicles generally happens as fuel tanks approach low levels, while recharging EVs from low or 0% states of charge will be infrequent,” Jaguar said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-303634" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JaguarMap.png" alt="" width="1035" height="777" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JaguarMap.png 1035w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JaguarMap-300x225.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JaguarMap-768x577.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JaguarMap-1024x769.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Its sleek, coupe-like silhouette is influenced by the Jaguar C-X75 supercar with a short, low bonnet, aero-enhanced roof design and curved rear screen. This cab-forward design contrasts with its squared-off rear, which helps reduce the drag co-efficient to just 0.29Cd. To optimise the balance between cooling and aerodynamics, Active Vanes in the grille open when cooling is required, but close when not needed to redirect air through the integral bonnet scoop, smoothing airflow. While a mid-sized SUV, I-PACE’s cab forward design and EV powertrain means interior space comparable to large SUVs, Jaguar said. In the rear, legroom is 890mm while, with no transmission tunnel, there’s a useful 10.5-litre central storage compartment. In the rear, tablet and laptop stowage is found beneath the seats, while the rear luggage compartment offers a 656-litre capacity – and 1,453-litres with seats folded flat. The I-Pace introduces the Touch Pro Duo infotainment system to Jaguar. To ensure owners always have access to the latest infotainment, telematics and battery energy control software, I-Pace will be the first Jaguar to provide software over-the-air – providing seamless updates.
