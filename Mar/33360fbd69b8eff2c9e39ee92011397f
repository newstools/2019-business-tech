Due to a shortage of capacity, Eskom has announced that it will implement stage 2 rotational load shedding from 08h00 today, with power cuts likely to continue until 23h00. “Stage 2 calls for 2000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period. “Load shedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout,”the power utility said in a statement. “We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand.” The group encouraged people to visit the websites of their electricity providers for a list of which areas will be affected. Eskom began load shedding for the first time since mid-February this week after power trips at its Medupi and Kusile coal-fired stations. Read: Why Eskom was always doomed to fail
