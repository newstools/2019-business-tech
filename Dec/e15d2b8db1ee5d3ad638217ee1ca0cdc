As many as 12 South African restaurants have been listed among the top 1,000 in the world – with two ranking inside the top 200. Based on the compilation of hundreds of guidebooks and millions of online reviews, La Liste offers the best global restaurant selection handpicked by discerning food critics and expert guides. The restaurants were ranked in the 2020 La Liste, which comprises 1,000 top restaurants around the world, all of which scored 75 points or higher in the group’s analysis. La Liste is inspired by “meta-classifications” used in the academic field (Shanghai ranking), sports (ATP) or other domains (movies, gaming): for each restaurant, the group summarises the evaluations available online or on paper. The ratings assigned by different guides and publications are harmonised and weighted. The result is an overall score between 0 and 100, rounded up to a quarter of a point, which determines the restaurant’s place in the world ranking. The Test Kitchen in Cape Town, and Restaurant Mosaic at the Orient in Pretoria, tied for the title of best restaurant in South Africa. Guy Savoy restaurant in Paris, owned by chef Guy Savoy, retained its title as the best restaurant globally, with Le Bernardin in New York, retaining second place. Ryugin in Chiyoda-ku, Japan, was third, followed by Sugalabo in Minato-ku, Japan, and L’Arpège in Paris.
