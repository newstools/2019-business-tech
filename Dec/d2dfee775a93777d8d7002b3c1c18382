By Chayan Bhattacharyay The digital transformation of businesses isn’t new. We need only look to Kodak and Nokia to see how even industry leaders have missed the impact of technology on how we work, what we offer our target markets, and most importantly, what consumers expect of brands and businesses. Kodak believed the world would always love film cameras and Nokia felt comfortable as the leader in cellular technology. The fact that Kodak had digital technology and didn’t aggressively enter the market with it first shows how quickly we can become complacent, choosing to stick with tried and tested ideas and solutions instead of embracing the evolution of how we work – and yet if we want to stay ahead of the game, we need to start embracing how technology can help us do everything we do, just better, faster, more efficiently and in most cases, more cost-effectively.

Consider this: Your employees have the latest iPhones and Android phones at home; they use Alexa or some other form of AI voice-controlled technology, they run their lives and families through apps and track their health, fitness and activities to make themselves faster, more efficient and more productive. And then they get to the office and are expected to perform admin-intensive, routine and mundane tasks, instead of machines taking care of that for them so that they can focus on high-value tasks. In many ways, businesses are simply not keeping up with what’s possible in the world – and it’s a problem. According to the McKinsey Global Survey, digital technologies are reshaping industry after industry, and following these trends no longer gives companies the edge – it simply helps them keep up with competitors. Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, and it’s this shift – not in just embracing technology, but really believing in its worth – that is fundamentally changing how we operate and deliver value to our customers. According to a recent Forbes article, even one of the most iconic brands in shoes and athletic clothing, Nike, realized that in order to remain competitive and, more importantly, relative, digital transformation was necessary. After spending two years reinventing itself and its supply chain, Nike has improved its connection to customers by using powerful data analytics, stronger digital marketing techniques and selling more directly to its audience. An enhanced digital focus has also helped Nike to speed up its product development cycle, which means new products get to market more quickly. Having the right customer data at its fingertips also means that the brand can respond to trends with speed and give on-point recommendations to customers based on their preferences and past purchases. This hasn’t been a vanity exercise – Nike’s stock prices have increased by 69% thanks to its far-reaching digital transformation initiatives. At Innovsoltech, our goal is to imagine what your business and employees could be achieving if work hours were spent on meaningful, revenue-generating activities and high-value tasks, while Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and AI could take care of routine tasks and even superior customer service thanks to the always-on, 24/7 nature of AI and technology. The reality is that with cognitive automation, businesses can do more with what they have. RPA and AI don’t replace humans – they augment them. By freeing up humans, our technologies and solutions empower workers, and the tools we have created build capabilities across the organization as a whole. Innovsoltech’s robotic process automation (RPA) platform, iRobo, offers intelligent automation solutions to repetitive work in a business process. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-360920" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="402" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.jpg 718w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> We are on a mission to enable every business in the world to let software robots do the repetitive, boring and tedious tasks to make them more efficient, reduce costs and help these businesses focus on innovation and growth to better serve their customers. The solution uses cognitive AI and computer vision technologies for identifying complex images and objects to make intelligent decisions far quicker and more accurately than ever before. It’s the ultimate partnership between machine and human, where we can all learn and achieve a lot more with extraordinary speed and accuracy. Similarly, we want to change the way businesses attract, on-board, serve and retain customers, as well as make new channels of communication available to people who have no other means to communicate easily with the business otherwise. Our conversational AI platform, Convo.Ai is an artificial intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based platform that allows customers to seamlessly reach their clients or perform business transactions via live chat or voice conversations. This helps both clients and their customers interact better, bringing them closer to each other and performing business transactions 24/7, with no human intervention. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-360918" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-1.jpg 731w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> To find out more about how Innovsoltech can help you grow, visit our website or subscribe to our YouTube channel.
