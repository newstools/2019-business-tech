Pick n Pay has launched a new mentorship app which will connect its small suppliers with experts across its business. The group said that the app mentor’s expertise will range from procurement, merchandising, compliance, supply chain, financial management, to marketing and human resources. The app aims to empower entrepreneurs with easy access to the mentorship and business development support they need to grow their business, Pick n Pay said. “Small businesses seldom have finance, operations or HR directors. As they grow, this is the kind of expertise they need to ensure they are successful and sustainable,” said Mishinga Seyuba Kombo, head of Pick n Pay Enterprise & Supplier Development. “So through the app, at no cost to them, we offer our small suppliers access to a network of Pick n Pay mentors who can offer guidance, their expertise, experience and knowledge of real life challenges and how to solve them.” The PnP Mentorship app launched internally in November 2019 and over 150 Pick n Pay staff members have already been verified on the app. Small suppliers need to be part of the PnP Enterprise and Supplier Development programme to have access to the mentorship app. Read: New Starbucks South Africa owner outlines plans for the coffee chain
