South Africa’s ruling African National Congress rejected media reports that a faction within the party was plotting to oust President Cyril Ramaphosa because his economic policies were supplanting its pro-poor stance. The ANC’s leadership remains united and is working well together, its Secretary-General Ace Magashule told reporters in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The party plans to convene a national general council in late June next year where 3,000 of its members will assess the progress it has made since its last national conference in late 2017, Magashule said. Citing inside sources, Ramaphosa’s opponents within the ruling party are reportedly plotting to oust him over reforms that they say are failing to benefit the poor, the Citizen reported. A campaign being led by African National Congress Secretary-General Ace Magashule aims to discredit him over economic policies that his opponents argue are supplanting the party’s pro-poor stance, the newspaper said. The anti-Ramaphosa faction wants Deputy President David Mabuza to become president, deputised by either Magashule or Water Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, it said. ANC spokesman Pule Mabe didn’t answer calls to his mobile seeking comment at the time. Magashule is an ally of former President Jacob Zuma, whose almost nine-year term was marred by a series of corruption scandals. Read: We will not allow any state-owned enterprises to fail: Ramaphosa
