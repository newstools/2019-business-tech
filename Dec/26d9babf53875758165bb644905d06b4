Eskom will introduce stage 2 rotational load shedding until 23h00 on Wednesday evening (11 December), it said in a statement. The embattled power utility said it would communicate if there is a change in the system during the day. “Load shedding has been reduced to stage 2 as we have made good progress in the system recovery largely as a result of several units being returned to service and the recovery from localised flooding at our power stations. “As the generating plant continues to perform at low levels of reliability, any unexpected shift such as an increase in unplanned breakdowns could result in a change in the load shedding stage at short notice.” Internal Eskom status updates reveal that a number of power stations across the country – including Koeberg nuclear power station, three turbines at two open-cycle gas turbines on the west and south coasts – have recently suffered a series of breakdowns, shutdowns and planned outages. Eskom said that the probability of load shedding also remains high for the rest of the week. Damage to economy Head of Capital Markets Research at Intellidex, Peter Attard Montalto, said that load shedding, SAA, fiscal deterioration and ratings are not enough of a threat or a shock to a faster pace of reform within a capacity-constrained state. “As such growth forecasts have fallen since the last reform tracker update even though notional the reform outlook has improved marginally,” he said. “We now see growth at 0.4% this year, 1.1% next year then 1.5% for 2021 and 1.9% for 2021 (from 0.6%, 1.5%, 1.7% and 1.9% previously) – but with strong downside risks still to these numbers. “With load shedding now this year could easily fall 0.1% and if load-shedding continues, next year by 0.5% or so.” Read: How the latest round of load shedding will hit South Africa’s economy
