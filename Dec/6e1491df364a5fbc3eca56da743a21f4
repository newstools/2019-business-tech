The demand for homes close to good schools has meant that a number of top suburbs have performed well this year despite economic challenges, new data from the Seeff Property Group shows. Seeff said that proximity to schools has become a top driver of demand in neighbourhoods while rising traffic has added further to the demand for these suburbs. As a result, the school-belt suburbs have been some of the best performing areas in 2019 and homes close to schools have continued to achieve premiums of around 20%-40% said Samuel Seeff, chairman of the Seeff Property Group. We have seen a trend of buyers with children migrating to areas with good schools and child-care facilities, he said. “While there is year-round demand for homes close to good schools, the demand usually picks up ahead of the new “school and varsity year as parents look to get closer to their schools of choice.” Below are some of the best performing school suburbs across the country.
