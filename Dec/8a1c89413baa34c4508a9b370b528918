Anyone who starts every new year off with ambitious resolutions knows how hard it is to stay committed to them. It is helpful to keep a simple, manageable approach to reaching your goals. The same goes for investing offshore. It’s easier to achieve your financial goals if you stay committed. And it’s easier to stay committed if you choose a multi-asset fund because you’ll have the comfort and ease of having a fund manager tasked with making the daily portfolio decisions for you.

The past does not predict the future, so the best approach is to appropriately diversify your risks across jurisdictions, geogra­phies, sectors and companies.

It’s easier to remain committed if you invest in a multi-asset fund Making consistently good investment decisions over time is not easy.
