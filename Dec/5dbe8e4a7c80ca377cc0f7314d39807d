Park Village Auctions and Bidders Choice have concluded the auction which saw the sale of assets stemming from the liquidation of several subsidiaries of African Global Operations – formerly Bosasa. Bosasa is a South African company specialising in providing services to government, most notably prison services. It is controversial for its involvement in corruption allegations exposed during the Zondo Commission of Inquiry. The accused company was recently ruled commercially insolvent and put into the hands of its liquidators, who contracted Park Village Auctions. The auctioneer said that between 4 and 6 December, more than a thousand registered bidders made their way to the former Bosasa headquarters in Krugersdorp. Some were seeking to pick up high-quality assets at bargain rates, while others wanted to claim their piece of scandalous South African history. Items for sale included: Three high-profile properties and a copper plant;
Hundreds of passenger and commercial vehicles;
Commercial containers;
Office equipment and furniture; executive suites;
Opulent household furniture and designer décor;
Catering, workshop, garden and state-of-the-art security equipment. In total, Park Village Auctions reports that over a thousand lots made up of the properties and the plant, machinery, equipment, vehicles and other movables fetched approximately R100 million excluding VAT. “We are pleased with the outcome of the auction and honoured to have been the liquidators’ choice auctioneers,” it said. “We trust that the realisation of these assets goes a long way in assisting the joint liquidators with their mammoth task of putting this concern bed.” Vehicles <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-361128" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BMW-X5.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BMW-X5.jpg 700w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BMW-X5-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Day one saw buyers purchase a number of cars including various Toyota models (such as Hilux, Fortuner, Avanza, Corollas, and Quantum), bakkies and minibuses as well as luxury vehicles that had been issued for personal use.
