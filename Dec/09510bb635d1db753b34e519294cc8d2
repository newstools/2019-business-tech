Eskom says it will implement stage 2 load shedding on Friday morning, which will continue throughout the day into Saturday. This follows the power utility having to extend load shedding on Thursday to the early hours of Friday morning. Initially planned for between 16h00 and 23h00 on Thursday, Eskom continued to lose generating capacity during the night, forcing it to extend the load shedding hours. As the group’s system remains extremely constrained, with unplanned outages exceeding 12,500MW, it will be forced to continue load shedding with extended hours. Eskom said that it is using diesel to ensure the stages do not escalate – of which is has sufficient supply – but it was unable to replenish its water resources overnight. Load shedding has been a lingering threat in South Africa since Eskom’s systems collapsed in the first quarter of the year, doing massive damage to the economy. Bloomberg reported that the impact of load shedding on the economy ranged between R1 billion and R5 billion a day. The Department of Energy, National Treasury and the Department of Public Enterprises have been working since then to maintain the volatile balance between supply and demand on the network. Before winter, Eskom outlined a plan to keep the lights on for the remainder of 2019; a plan that hinged on unplanned maintenance on generating units never exceeding 9,500MW being taken offline.
