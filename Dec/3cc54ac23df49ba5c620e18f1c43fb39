Boutique wine farms are in high demand especially to around the R30 million price mark, says real estate agency Seeff. Boutique wine farms tend to limit financial exposure, hence the higher demand. There is however limited availability in the Stellenbosch area, but buyers and investors can find more stock in the Paarl and Wellington region. Interest is coming from local and international buyers, said Kevin Layden, Seeff agent for farms in the Stellenbosch and Boland. “Generally, boutique farms are selling in the R20m-R40m range and commercial wine farms in the R50 million – R75 million range. “Top-end wine brands on the market range from around R100 million – R250 million, but at this end of the market they are not actively promoted and marketed and sold on a confidential basis,” said Layden. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359464 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dieu-Donne-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dieu-Donne-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dieu-Donne-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dieu-Donne-768x576.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dieu-Donne-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dieu-Donne-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dieu-Donne.jpg 1972w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359466 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/La-Bourgogne-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/La-Bourgogne-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/La-Bourgogne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/La-Bourgogne-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/La-Bourgogne-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/La-Bourgogne-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/La-Bourgogne.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359468 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tulbagh-1024x587.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="482" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tulbagh-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tulbagh-300x172.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tulbagh-768x440.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tulbagh-1536x880.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tulbagh-2048x1173.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tulbagh-1200x687.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> South Africa’s wine farms continue to attract tourism from across the country and globe.
