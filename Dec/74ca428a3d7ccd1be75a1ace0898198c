The first is the rapid adoption of online shopping by the South African population. The second is the equally rapid adoption of Click and Collect – allowing Pargo to create access to online shopping through affordable, reliable and convenient last-mile logistics in even the most difficult to reach regions of South Africa. According to BusinessTech, South Africa spent more than R6 billion over the 2019 Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Notably, 595,792 transactions were processed during the hour of 10:00 and 11:00 – compared to 2018’s peak of 410,364 transactions which were processed during the hour of 16:00 and 17:00. Given that most Black Friday purchases happened during the late morning of a prescribed working day, shopping online has proven to be a significant help for customers. Pargo’s Pick-up Point solution was a huge success in providing an alternative to traditional deliveries, as well as customers who preferred not to be in the rush of Black Friday/Cyber Monday queues. Pargo’s innovative delivery method allowed customers the option to collect their online shopping at a local Pargo Point at a time that suited them. “Pargo’s constant growth as the leaders of Click and Collect in South Africa is a testament to the success of our customer-centric service that is tailor-made for South Africans who have previously been excluded from online shopping. We will continue to create access to Ecommerce for anybody in Africa,” added Lars.
