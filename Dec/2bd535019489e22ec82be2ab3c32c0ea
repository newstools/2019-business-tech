The most common scams are: Tech support fraud, where someone pretends to call from your bank or a company saying that your account has been hijacked and needs your help to take control of it.
One ring scam, an unknown number (usually an international number) gives you a missed call and when you call them back you get charged a hefty fee for calling to that number.
Job offer scam, someone pretends to be a headhunter calling you to offer you a job but you need to pay a fee in order to get the job. <img class="size-full wp-image-359496 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Spam-2.png" alt="" width="768" height="485" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Spam-2.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Spam-2-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Truecaller said insurance-related calls have also seen a big uptake in the country. “Lately, there have been complaints about insurance companies calling people to upsell car insurance – or scammers calling pretending that your car has been towed away and that you need to pay a fee to get it back,” it said.
