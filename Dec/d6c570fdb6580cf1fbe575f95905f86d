While a culture of tipping is common in South Africa, it does not always extend to petrol attendants, a new BusinessTech poll shows. The poll, which was conducted at the start of December 2019 and drew over 2,900 responses, shows that South Africans are a little bit more stingy when it comes to service people at the pumps. When asked how much money motorists usually tip the petrol attendant when they visit a service station, the largest proportion of respondents (41%%) said they don’t give anything at all. By comparison, 32% said that they tip R5, followed by those who give R10 (14%) and R2 (8%). Just 4% of respondents said that they tip R20. <img class="size-full wp-image-359187 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Petrol-attendants.png" alt="" width="276" height="350" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Petrol-attendants.png 276w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Petrol-attendants-237x300.png 237w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 85vw, 276px" /> According to the latest jobs data, petrol stations employ around 70,000 people across the country, with petrol attendants generally fitting the profile of 27-year-old men, who tend to stay in the job for up to five years. The Department of Energy employment numbers for 2018/2019 showed that forecourt attendants earn a minimum of R1,313.55 per week (R5,250 a month), or R29.19 per hour, while cashiers earn slightly more (R1,382.40 per week). Salary data for the industry showed that generally petrol attendants earn just above this minimum wage at R5,600 a month, going as high as R8,000 a month in some cases.
