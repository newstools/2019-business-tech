Jobs website Glassdoor has published a new guide on what the perfect cover letter should look like. It said that your cover letter should include some of the key skills, traits and experience highlighted in your CV. However, it warned that copying and pasting from there into your cover letter will most definitely turn recruiters off. “Odds are they’ve already read your resume — why would you make them waste their time reading the same thing over again? “Cover letters are your opportunity to not only show that you have the background and knowledge needed to do the job well, but that you’re also passionate, charismatic and well-informed,” Glassdoor said. Below it provided an ideal cover letter template and tips on what to include. <img class="size-full wp-image-352095 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cover-letter.png" alt="" width="778" height="1024" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cover-letter.png 778w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cover-letter-228x300.png 228w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cover-letter-768x1011.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> 1. Contact Info Don’t make recruiters dig through your cover letter to find your name and contact info — include it up top so they can easily reach out. 2. Greeting Forget “To Whom It May Concern”. If you can find it, address the recruiter/hiring manager by name. 3. Intro Paragraph Relevant anecdotes, quotes, fun facts, etc. are all good ways to make your opening line stand out;
Make it clear that you know who the company is, what they do and what they care about;
Mention a few roles, projects, experiences, traits or passions that make you the ideal candidate;
If someone at the company has referred you, this is the place to name drop them. 4. Body Paragraph(s) Incorporate keywords directly from the job description;
Whenever possible, include concrete metrics that illustrate the results you’ve achieved. 5. Closing Paragraph: Summarize, don’t plagiarize. Reaffirm your interest, passion and qualifications from earlier in the letter, but don’t make it sound redundant. 6. Additional Cover letters should be clean and easy to read — save the intricate designs and crazy fonts for party invitations;
Like a resume, keep the cover letter to one page. If necessary, hyperlink your portfolio, website or samples of your work;
Saving your cover letter as a PDF file will ensure the formatting won’t change. Read: 50 of the most common questions you should be prepared to answer at your next job interview
