Data centre group, Teraco, has announced that Lex Van Wyk will step down as chief executive officer (CEO), effective 1 January 2020. Van Wyk will be succeeded by Jan Hnizdo, who has been an executive director of Teraco since 2011, having initially joined Teraco in the position of chief financial officer (CFO), and as managing director since early 2018. As one of the founders of Teraco in 2008 and as CEO since 2013, van Wyk previously served as managing director. “In this time, he has been instrumental in growing the business from its early stages as a start-up data centre in Cape Town to Africa’s largest data centre as it is known today,” the group said “Van Wyk and his Teraco team also played a pivotal role during this time to change the South Africa telecommunications landscape. As the first vendor neutral data centre in Africa, Teraco also launched Africa’s largest internet exchange, NAPAfrica in 2012. “This changed the way the African continent accessed content, while also making the Internet more easily available, and at a significantly reduced cost.” Since launching, Teraco has established itself as the largest provider of data centre colocation space in Africa with more than 50MW of available critical power load, 20,000 sqm of built out colocation space and 16,000 interconnects between its ecosystem of carriers, content and cloud providers, outsourced service providers and key enterprise partners. Van Wyk said that after 11 years, it felt like the timing was right to step aside. He will remain a shareholder in Teraco and will continue to serve on the board in the capacity of non-executive director. Read: US private equity firm buys major stake in Teraco
