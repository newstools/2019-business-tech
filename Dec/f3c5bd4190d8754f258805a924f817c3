President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered failed airline South African Airways (SAA) to enter into voluntary business rescue. In a leaked letter sent out on Wednesday evening (4 December) the office of the presidency said that the situation at the airline has become so dire that previous plans to restructure the business needs to pivot to this new direction – urgently. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko confirmed to TimesLIVE that the letter was official correspondence. The letter reads: Earlier on Wednesday, minister of public enterprises Pravin Gordhan, agreed that the next best option, other than liquidation, to stop the multi-billion rand taxpayer bailouts to SAA would be to put the national carrier into business rescue. DA MP Alf Lees said that Gordhan’s comments showed that sense has finally prevailed regarding the airline, but warned that the pressure on South Africa’s fiscus is far from over. “It is very unlikely that the application for Business Rescue for SAA will be conceded to unless there is a further bailout, presumably amounting to R2 billion, from the South African taxpayer in order to provide the working capital required to enable SAA to continue trading,” he said. “With business rescue will come an obligation for the government guarantees of R19.1 billion to be honoured. This will require an increase in sovereign borrowings that in turn will increase debt service costs and place a further burden on taxpayers.” However, he said that if business rescue is awarded then it will take control of SAA out of the hands of the ANC, which can only be a good thing for the airline. “The business practitioner who is appointed must take robust action to immediately cut costs at SAA without any interference from the ANC. The DA will monitor this very closely in order to ensure that the ANC keeps its distance.” Read: SAA in limbo as government considers bailout
