Ask a question. Makro’s Intelligent Assistant (iA) was developed by Feersum Engine, a product that allows brands to connect with their consumers on the device of their choice. Feersum’s human-centred approach means that they’re constantly finding ways to improve the Makro user experience and will keep adding features to its chat service on WhatsApp. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359716 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Makro-512x1024.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="1024" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Makro-512x1024.jpg 512w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Makro-150x300.jpg 150w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Makro-768x1536.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Makro-1024x2048.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Makro.jpg 1069w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 85vw, 512px" /> “Customers can now access the information they want, when they want it, without having to endure a lengthy phone call or escalate potential queries,” said the head of digital marketing at Makro, Kerry Ho. “This bold step towards the future of customer service ensures customers have the best experience on their own terms. “The addition and implementation of exciting functions in WhatsApp align with Makro’s mission to help our customers fulfil their aspirations of living better lives, running better businesses, and saving them time and money.” Customers can access the new feature by adding 0860 300 999 as a contact on WhatsApp. Read: South Africans can now renew their car licence on WhatsApp
