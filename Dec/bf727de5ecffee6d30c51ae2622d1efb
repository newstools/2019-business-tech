The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) will use a number of new tech over the festive season, including squad cars with a built-in number plate recognition system. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula said in a presentation on Monday (2 December), that the technology enables traffic officers to scan all vehicles and know immediately if it has been stolen or if there are warrants for the owner and other important information. The onboard system will also pull information from a national database including the driver’s licensing details, outstanding fines and traffic violations. A similar technology was recently introduced by the eThekwini municipality in Durban ahead of the festive season. Speaking to BusinessTech, eThekwini metro police spokesperson, senior superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, said that this dashboard feed is continuous and downloads to a cloud storage site. He added that the car has its own WiFi system which makes this connectivity possible. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359065" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Internal.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Internal.jpg 960w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Internal-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Internal-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359059 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-3-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-3-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-3.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Mbalula also unveiled the JMPD’s new Mobile Alcohol Evidentiary Breath Alcohol Testing (EBAT) vehicles. EBAT vehicles are specially converted panel vans equipped to enable officers to take evidentiary breath samples from motorists anywhere, any time. Positive samples can be used in court to convict motorists driving under the influence, removing the need for a blood test. The vehicles are deployed in support of roadblocks and Random Breath Testing (RBT) operations. The EBAT system differs from blood tests in that the results are immediate. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359073 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ebat-3-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ebat-3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ebat-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ebat-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ebat-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ebat-3-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ebat-3.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359069 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-1-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-359071 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="630" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-2-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Traffic-2.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Durban’s police force is getting cool new tech
