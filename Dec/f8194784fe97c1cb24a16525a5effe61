Eskom has announced that it will implement stage 2 load shedding on Thursday (5 November), from 16h00. “Eskom regrets that Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 16h00 to 23h00 today due to a shortage of capacity,” it said. The struggling power utility has managed to avoid load shedding for almost a month, with the last round hitting early in November. Load shedding has been a lingering threat in South Africa since Eskom’s systems collapsed in the first quarter of the year, doing massive damage to the economy. Bloomberg reported that the impact of load shedding on the economy ranged between R1 billion and R5 billion a day. The Department of Energy, National Treasury and the Department of Public Enterprises have been working since then to maintain the volatile balance between supply and demand on the network. Before winter, Eskom outlined a plan to keep the lights on for the remainder of 2019; a plan that hinged on unplanned maintenance on generating units never exceeding 9,500MW being taken offline. However, over the last few weeks, this has exceeded 10,000MW. Earlier on Thursday, Eskom said its system was constrained and vulnerable, with generating plant performing at very low levels of reliability. Unplanned breakdowns were at 12,300MW at 10h00.
