NETGEAR has added new features to its award-winning Insight management solution, including a new 4-port integrated gigabit Ethernet switch, Wi-Fi mesh access point, an Insight supported 10-port gigabit switch with greater PoE capacity, Insight support on more Smart Pro Managed switches and the addition of Instant Captive Portal for all Insight managed wireless products. Click here to find out more about NETGEAR’s Insight cloud management solution. “NETGEAR Insight cloud management solution, now in its third year, has proven to be a powerful tool for small businesses to manage their networks remotely or for managed service providers to better keep tabs on the health of their client networks,” said Tobie van Schalkwyk, product manager for NETGEAR at Duxbury Networking, distributor of NETGEAR switch solutions. “The Insight platform offers support for 22 different switches, access points and security devices managed by way of a free mobile application accessible on both iOS and Android as well as multi-customer desktop solutions for service providers.” New features of the Insight remote management solution include: NETGEAR Insight Instant Mesh
NETGEAR Insight Instant Mesh combines two industry leading and innovative technologies: patented tri-band mesh Wi-Fi and the Insight remote management platform.
Instant Mesh supports NETGEAR’s commercial-grade, high-performance wireless access point, the WAC540, and the newly released mesh Wi-Fi multi-mode access point WAC564. With the use of the Insight App and a few taps of the screen, a network can be easily expanded to increase the coverage area by adding up to five units of WAC540 or WAC564. One of the five units will need to be designated as the root, which connects the Wi-Fi network to the internet; and the other four units are named as extenders to expand the reach of the Wi-Fi coverage. Either WAC540 or the WAC564 can be the root or the extender, configured by the user, or configured and optimised by Insight automatically. WAC540 and WAC564 can be used in a mix-and-match fashion, giving businesses the ultimate flexibility in network design and deployment. The WAC540 is ideal for businesses that run on Wi-Fi networks. Its PoE feature and the industrial design are ideal for either ceiling mounting or wall-mounted placement. The WAC564, with its integrated 4-port gigabit Ethernet switch, designed for either desktop or wall mounting, is ideal for businesses that run on a mix of both Wi-Fi and Ethernet networks. “The WAC564 is industry’s first multi-mode Wi-Fi access point that can perform as a root or an extender in a Wi-Fi mesh network, or as a powerful standalone Wi-Fi access point. With its integrated 4-port gigabit Ethernet switch, businesses can now expand their wired and wireless networks seamlessly, supporting multiple unified SSIDs and VLANs,” said Van Schalkwyk. In Access Point mode, users can enjoy the powerful AC3000 tri-band Wi-Fi. The WAC564 includes three separate radios – a 2.4GHz and two 5GHz (low and high frequency bands) – bringing a total of 3Gbps throughput to any Wi-Fi devices. The WAC564 offers advanced and easy-to-manage Wi-Fi features such as band-steering, beamforming, load balancing, airtime fairness, and advanced roaming. In Mesh Extender mode, each WAC564 connects over the air to the WAC564 or WAC540, creating an instant Wi-Fi mesh network of one root and multiple extenders that quadruples the range of coverage with unified SSID and VLAN settings, providing the ultimate secure Wi-Fi experience for any business. The WAC564 helps small businesses expand the network and provide powerful Wi-Fi services: Nearby rooms where cabling is not available and in range of current Wi-Fi reception

48-Port Gigabit PoE+ Smart Managed Pro Switch (GS752TPv2)
48-Port Gigabit PoE+ Smart Managed Pro Switch (GS752TPPv1) With its sturdy metal case, fanless design and desktop or wall-mount positioning, the GS305PP is the ideal upgrade to any network for the easy installation of four PoE+ devices in the home or office. It automatically connects to one’s router for the instant addition of four wired connections for high-speed non-blocking Gigabit connectivity. Key features: Most cost-effective 5-port PoE+ Gigabit switch with 83W total budget – Connect multiple power-demanding devices to a network with a single wire for power and connectivity
Ideal for small installations of four PoE+ devices (IP phone, wired surveillance camera, wireless access point) – Install just the number of ports one needs, with no additional configuration
