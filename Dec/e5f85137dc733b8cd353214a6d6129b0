Vehicle evaluation group True Price has published a new report comparing the resale value of South Africa’s most popular mid-sized SUVs. The data is based on thousands of vehicles sold on auction around South Africa. True Price documents each and every price paid on auction, focusing on vehicles that have done a maximum of 150,000 km and were registered between 2016 and 2019. It then calculates the actual price achieved on auction as a percentage of the original list price to determine a resale value percentage. Using this data, True Price found that Audi Q5 has the best resale value in South Africa  – just beating out the Mercedes-Benz GLC. The resale value of mid-sized SUVs The Q5 achieved 70.68% which is a very good score, said True Price MD Darryl Jacobson. “Personally, I love its looks. When I observe auctions, I see that it appeals to private buyers – especially younger and more affluent motorists. The Mercedes-Benz – with a score of 70.65% – is also a great buy and always attracts a great deal of attention on auction, he said. “It remains a status symbol for buyers and it has universal appeal. The engine is impressive, as is the amount of interior space.” The BMW X3 is third on the list Jacobson said that the X3 offers terrific ride and handling, the interior is extremely well equipped, and it ticks all the boxes when it comes to technology. “It is very popular with the mom’s soccer team lift club; buyers like the fact that it is large and spacious but not too large to manoeuvre around town. It’s especially appealing to buyers when the motor plan is still intact,” he said. Read: These are the second-hand cars South Africans are buying right now
