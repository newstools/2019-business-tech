Eskom has announced that load shedding will be boosted to stage 4 on Monday, following the loss of more generating units. “We regret that due to additional loss of units at our power stations, Stage 2 load shedding will move to Stage 4 as from 10h00 to 23h00,” it said. Stage 2 load shedding was implemented on Monday morning, following the loss of generating units over the weekend, forcing the power utility to use its water and diesel reserves. Eskom warned that the probability of load-shedding would remain high throughout the coming week due to the shortage of capacity. It had lost additional power generation units during the course of the day on Sunday 8 December 2019, which resulted in unplanned breakdowns increasing to 12,000MW by 19h00. To cope with the loss of these units, Eskom was forced to increase its reliance on diesel and water at its open-cycle gas turbines and pumped storage schemes. “Regrettably, as a result, we have been unable to conserve water and diesel as required to stop or to minimise load-shedding for the coming week,” Eskom said. “We remind customers that load-shedding is a responsible act to prevent a national blackout.” Load shedding schedules Customers can find their various load shedding schedules on their local metro or municipal websites, where applicable, or from Eskom directly.
