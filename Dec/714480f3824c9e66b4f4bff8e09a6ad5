Arton Capital, a provider of residency and citizenship solutions, has released its latest Passport Index – a system that ranks travel documents by the number of countries that can be visited without having to apply for a visa. The latest index shows that the UAE has the most powerful passport in the world. With a Mobility Score of 178, Emiratis now enjoy visa-free or visa on arrival to 90% of the world. Currently in the top three, following the UAE, are Germany, Finland, Luxembourg and Spain in second place with a Mobility Score of 171. Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, Ireland, and USA share third place with a Mobility Score of 170. Increasingly, countries are recognizing the value and power of passports which represent more than just identity, but rather a vital tool that influences global opportunity, mobility and quality of life. South Africa While South Africa ranks 43rd on the overall list, it has shown steady annual improvements – rising to 94 countries in 2018 from 90 countries at the end of 2017. This number could increase even further in 2020 as the Department of Home Affairs plans to implement a range of visa changes to encourage foreign investment and travel. Below BusinessTech looked at the countries South Africans can currently visit without a visa heading into 2020.
