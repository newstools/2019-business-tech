The parliamentary committee on land expropriation has published its new draft bill for public comment. The bill aims to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow for land expropriation without providing compensation. However, the bill itself does not specify the circumstances when no compensation may be given. Instead, it states that a separate piece of national legislation must set out the specific circumstances where a court may determine that the amount of compensation is nil. Previously, Section 25 read: The amendment adds the following to S25 (2)(b): and adds this section as S25 (3)(a) Written submissions must be received by no later than Friday, 31 January 2020. Submissions and enquiries must be directed to Mr V Ramaano at this email address.
