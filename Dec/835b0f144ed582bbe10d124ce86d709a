Nedbank has published its updated fee schedule for banking customers in 2020, with prices largely unchanged. The South African banking market has become highly competitive in 2019, particularly with a host of new accounts targeting the entry-level (typically low-income) markets. Accounts in this sector now offer ‘zero banking’, with the pressure on legacy banks (Absa, Standard Bank, Nedbank, FNB and Capitec) to meet the price points of new, digital entrants (TymeBank, Bank Zero) which offer zero monthly fees and a host of free transactions. This pressure on Nedbank was evident as early as April 2019, when the bank moved to snuff out the monthly account fee on its entry-level transactional account, the PAYU account. Across the rest of its accounts, monthly fees have increased between 4.5% and 6.5%. There are the changes to Nedbank’s accounts: MobiMoney: Free (no change)
PAYU: Free (down from R5.30)
Ke Yona: R62.00 (up 6.5% from R58.00)
Savvy Plus: R115.00 (up 4.5% from R110.00)
Savvy Bundle: R210.00 (up 5.0% from R200.00) Entry-level account Nedbank made changes to its entry level Pas As You Use (PAYU) account in April, when it dropped the monthly fee on the account altogether – pitting it against the new zero-free bank accounts that had just launched into the local market. This has continued through to 2020, with virtually no other changes to the fees in this account. As with similar accounts, the flat rate for withdrawals at native ATMs has been altered slightly and is now on a ‘per R1000′ basis. The fee of R7.00 in this formula remains unchanged from 2019. The only big change comes from the fee to withdraw from other banks’ ATMs, which now sees a R10 fee attached to normal rates. Other accounts With Nedbank’s other accounts, the biggest change comes with the dropping of deposit fees at Nedbank ATMs with the Savvy accounts. There was previously a limit of R5,000 in deposits at Nedbank ATMs before reverting to a standard formula. This carries over to the higher-tiered Savvy Bundle account as well.
