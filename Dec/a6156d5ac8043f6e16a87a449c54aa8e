As the torrential downpours over northern South Africa continue, the Department of Water and Sanitation has warned Gauteng residents against crossing flooded rivers and bridges over the next two days. Social media has been flooded with photos of the devastation caused by floods in Gauteng, with Tshwane and Mamelodi appearing to be hardest hit. The South African Weather Service has predicted that the heavy rains will continue until Wednesday when the downpours will begin to subside. “Heavy rain leading to localised flooding is expected across Gauteng, eastern North West Province and the north-eastern parts of Limpopo on Monday. Flooding is expected over the southern and western parts of Mpumalanga and in Gauteng on Monday,” the weather service said. Emer-G-Med and Arrive Alive reported that a military helicopter was used to help those trapped in Centurion although the SANDF has yet to confirm ant official rescue operations.    Precautions for heavy rains Stay indoors and off the road, avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams, where water is above your ankle;
If trapped in a vehicle, abandon it and climb to higher ground;
In buildings, move valuables to a safe place above the expected flood level;
Switch off electricity at the supply point to the building;
In rural areas, protect/relocate animals to a safe place on higher ground;
Abandon your home immediately if evacuation is recommended, before access is cut off by flood water;
Never drive on a road covered by water, you do not know how deep it is or if the road has been washed away;
If the vehicle stalls, leave immediately and seek higher ground; and
Be especially cautious at night when it harder to recognise flood dangers. Read: Massive cuts to minister perks in South Africa – including no cars over R700,000
