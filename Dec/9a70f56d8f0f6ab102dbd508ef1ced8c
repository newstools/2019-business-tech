The MTN Group says it has noted the release of the Competition Commission of South Africa’s report on data services in South Africa and is currently studying the full findings. In a shareholder statement on Wednesday (4 December), the group said that it was also reviewing the Icasa discussion document released at the end of November. “We reiterate comments made earlier in the year that MTN South Africa has substantially reduced the effective price of data in South Africa, having also invested heavily in the network to accommodate growing data demand with limited spectrum availability. “MTN Group has invested over R50 billion in the South African network in the last five years and has pledged a further R50 billion of investment over the next five years as part of delivering a world-class network for all South Africans.” It added that will continue with its pricing transformation initiatives across all its markets to make sure its services are more affordable for customers. Spectrum The group said that radio spectrum is the ‘digital highway’ upon which it depends to carry increasing mobile data at more cost-effective prices. It added that South Africa that has amongst the lowest spectrum allocation across all of MTN’s markets. “The release of new spectrum in this market will greatly assist our ability to service more customers with more data traffic,” it said. “We respectfully disagree with the analysis and recommendations contained in the summary report and, as we study the full report, will continue to engage constructively and vigorously defend against overbroad and intrusive recommendations.” Read: MTN and Vodacom shares hammered after Competition Commission findings
