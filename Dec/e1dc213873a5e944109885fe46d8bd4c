The Western Cape government is preparing for a bumper holiday season and plans to introduce a number of interventions to ensure the province’s roads are safe. To ensure that the province’s roads remain safe, the provincial department of transport said that it would focus on policing a number of problem areas, including alcohol abuse and speeding. It said that its provincial traffic services have had 167 patrol vehicles fitted with new in-vehicle technology to help with this. These cars have Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) capability which enables our officers to determine the roadworthiness, validity of operating licences and clearance certificates, it said. The patrol vehicles can also stream live footage to the province’s Central Communication Centres as well as receive on-board alerts for any speed contraventions through any of the Average Speed Over Distance (ASOD) sites on all national roads within the province. The province said that it has already seen an influx of vehicles into the province as holiday-goers travel to their respective destinations. It said that the province saw a significant decrease in the number of vehicles travelling through Cape Town in the 2018 festive period – largely due to the water restrictions that were in place at the time – but this year these fortunes will be reversed. “We are (expecting) to see a significant influx of motor vehicles into Cape Town this year as a result of water shortages that the rest of our country is facing.” The start of the school holidays, industry closure, as well as the increase in the number of international and local events being hosted in the Western Cape will contribute to this influx, it said.
