Eskom has said that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding until 23h00 on Monday 9 December. The power utility added that the probability of load-shedding would remain high throughout the coming week due to the shortage of capacity. Eskom said that it had lost additional power generation units during the course of the day on Sunday 8 December 2019, which resulted in unplanned breakdowns increasing to 12,000MW by 19h00.  To cope with the loss of these units, Eskom was forced to increase its reliance on diesel and water at its open-cycle gas turbines and pumped storage schemes. “Regrettably, as a result, we have been unable to conserve water and diesel as required to stop or to minimise load-shedding for the coming week,” Eskom said. “We remind customers that load-shedding is a responsible act to prevent a national blackout.” Read: Why Eskom expects a R20 billion full year loss – despite turning a mid-year profit
