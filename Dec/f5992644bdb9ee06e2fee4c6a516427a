Eskom says it does not expect load shedding on Tuesday, and the risk remains low for the rest of the week – but it is still trying to bring unplanned breakdowns under 9,500MW. The 9,500MW level is what Eskom determines as the ‘safe’ zone to ensure load shedding does not hit. The recent bout of load shedding, which lasted over a week, saw these breakdowns surpass 12,500MW, with heavy rains, alleged acts of sabotage and further operational failures pushing rolling blackouts to stage 6. “There is no load shedding expected today and the probability of load shedding is low for the week,” Eskom said. “We will continue to use emergency reserves to supplement capacity if necessary over this period. However, we remind customers that as the system remains vulnerable, load shedding could be implemented at short notice if there is a change on the system.” Eskom said its technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period to monitor the situation, and work towards bringing unplanned breakdowns under 9,500MW. Demand on the national grid is lower due to the closure of some industries over the holiday period, but the power utility asked that consumers, too, continue reducing demand.
