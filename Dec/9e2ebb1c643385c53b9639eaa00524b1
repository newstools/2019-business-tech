Engen and Clicks have launched a new partnership which will reward motorists every time they swipe their Clicks ClubCard at participating Engen service stations. The programme will see 1 litre of fuel accrue 1 reward point, with motorists earning double points every day from 1 December 2019 to 31 January 2020 (ie, 1 litre = 2 points). These points are awarded when motorists fill up with Engen Primax Unleaded or Engen Dynamic Diesel 50ppm at participating stations. The groups said that cashback is loaded six times a year and can be redeemed online on the Clicks website and at all Clicks, Claire’s and Body Shop stores nationwide. Engen operates over 1,000 service stations across South Africa. “As Engen continues to have South Africa’s largest service station footprint, it makes sense for us to partner with Clicks ClubCard, which is South Africa’s number one retail loyalty programme,” said Seelan Naidoo, Engen general manager. The new programme will officially launch on 2 December 2019. Read: Nedbank’s new rewards scheme could help pay off home loans and fund holidays for some users
