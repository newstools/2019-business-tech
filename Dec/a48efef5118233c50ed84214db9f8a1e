Parliament’s committee on land expropriation has agreed to publish its new draft bill in the government gazette next week. The bill aims to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow for land expropriation without compensation. Section 25 of South Africa’s Constitution currently states that where compensation is payable for the expropriation of land by the state, the amount payable should be ‘just and equitable’. It further states that ‘the time and manner of payment must be just and equitable, reflecting an equitable balance between the public interest and the interest of those affected.’ In a meeting on Thursday (5 December) committee chairperson, Dr Mathole Motshekga, said the draft bill will open the door for public participation. He said that the committee intends to publish an advert on 2 January 2020 that calls for public input until 31 January 2020. “This will ensure that we comply with the Constitution something which is of paramount importance. The flexibility of the dates for public input also covers the concerns regarding that matter.” Motshekga said the committee will ensure that all the views are tested as that is in line with South Africa’s participatory democracy. “The process is continuous. Political parties that still want to make further proposals will not be precluded from doing so,” he said. Read: What land expropriation without compensation will mean for homeowners in South Africa
