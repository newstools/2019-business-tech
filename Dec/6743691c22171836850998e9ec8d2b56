Mining was up by R11 billion to R101 billion;
Manufacturing was up by R8 billion to R153 billion;
Electricity, gas and water was down by R5 billion to R46 billion;
Agriculture was down by R7 billion to R29 billion. Little hope StatsSA showed a higher-than-expected GDP figure of 3.1% (seasonally adjusted, annualised) for Q2 2019, while annual growth also exceeded expectations, coming in at 0.9%. However, Bloomberg predicted that the rebound in South Africa’s economy in the second quarter would be fleeting as growth disappeared. It predicated that the GDP would likely show zero growth for the three months through September, citing a median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Africa’s most-advanced economy can’t seem to escape stagnation with failing state companies and ballooning debt sapping confidence, and pointing to little or no expansion for another year. <img class="size-full wp-image-359269 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GDP-1.jpg" alt="" width="814" height="469" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GDP-1.jpg 814w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GDP-1-300x173.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GDP-1-768x442.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Trouble ahead for the rand?
