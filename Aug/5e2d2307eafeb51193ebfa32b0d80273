Opportunities for South Africans Breytenbachs said that this new immigration route will create many opportunities for professionals in STEM. “The new fast-track visa will offer great opportunities for individuals who qualify under this immigration route,” it said. “Persons who apply successfully will receive a three-year visa. During their stay in the UK they can come and go from the UK at will. They will also qualify for Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK, after only three years. “Dependents of the main visa holder will be able to join the main holder in the UK. Adult dependents will be able to work in the UK without any restriction.” Another major advantage of this new visa route, is that this new visas will have no minimum salary requirement or minimum salary threshold.
