Despite the rise of new technologies such as streaming and improved broadband connectivity, radio still remains big business in South Africa. The latest statistics published by the Broadcast Research Council of South Africa show that many of these still receive a weekly listenership of over a million people in a wide variety of languages. The largest station is Durban-based Ukhozi FM which caters to the needs of the Zulu-speaking community. Between October 2018 and March 2019 the station had 7.6 million listeners a week. This is far ahead of the second most popular station Umhlobo Wenene FM – a station which focuses on the Xhosa language-speaking community – which had 5.4 million listeners a week over the same time period. Rounding up the top three is Metro FM with 4.3 million listeners a week. You can find the list of the 20 most popular radio stations outlined below.
