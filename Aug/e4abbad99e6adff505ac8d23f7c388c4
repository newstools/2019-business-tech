Click here for more on DStv’s #WomenAre campaign. On the set of a recent DStv campaign, she spoke a bit about the pressure to conform to fit in. Each of the women on set, who included model and activist Thando Hopa, Banyana captain Janine van Wyk and Supersport presenter Motshidisi Mohono were asked to come up with a single word to describe women, for Women’s Month. Mandisa chose: awe-inspiring. “I am a Hawk pilot – a Hawk Mk120 Commander, says Mandisa. And when you’re in a male-dominated field or a field where you’re a pioneer or you’re the first one in line, you want to try to assimilate to what is already there, and sometimes you can lose yourself.” “Stand in your truth, be authentic and give from your gifts and that’s how you can be awe-inspiring as a woman.” Check out this playlist of DStv favourites inspired by Mandisa » Here’s some behind the scenes footage of her in the DStv #WomenAre campaign.
