Cell C has finalised a term sheet which details a further national roaming agreement with MTN. “This agreement lays the groundwork for a broader national roaming agreement, supporting the policy goals of avoiding network duplication and the burden on the environment, where shared infrastructure drives efficiencies in the delivery of services to consumers,” said Cell C CEO Douglas Craigie Stevenson. Under the terms of this finalised agreement, Cell C said it would be able to manage its network capacity requirements in a more scalable and cost-efficient manner. “This is in line with our commitment to launch a business model that drives efficiency throughout the business,” Craigie Stevenson said. MTN and Cell C implemented the national roaming agreement in November 2018, which saw MTN providing 3G and LTE services to Cell C customers in certain areas, allowing for greater coverage outside of greater urban regions. Cell C said its new management team has been focusing on recapitalising the business and optimising its usage from the roaming agreement with MTN. The mobile operator said it has secured additional funding, adding that the Buffet recapitalisation is also on track. Read: Cell C appoints new CEO
