Citroën is bringing new cars to South Africa later in 2019 as the French carmaker looks to re-enter the market. In 2016, Citroën announced that it would discontinue new car sales in the country. Citing poor sales for the decision, the company said at the time that Peugeot-Citroën South Africa (PCSA) would continue to service its current customer base, honouring warranties and service plans through its PCSA dealer network. Speaking to BusinessTech, the PCSA’s Sharon Garson said that while the company had technically never left the country, this would be the first time in several years that it will be introducing new models. “Citroën never left South Africa and we have always had a presence in the country,” she said. “However, this is the first time in two to three years that Citroën will be introducing new cars to the market.” Garson said that the company had decided to take this hiatus as the current model line-up did not appeal to the current South African market. She declined to comment on which cars would be making their way to the South African market, but confirmed that an announcement would be made later this year.
