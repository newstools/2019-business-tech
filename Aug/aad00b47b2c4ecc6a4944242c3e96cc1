MTN’s fibre arm,  Supersonic, says it has launched a new pricing model that standardises its bundles across all South Africa’s Fibre Network Operators (FNO) – for all new customers. The pricing model categorises the upload and download speeds both in synchronous and asynchronous environments and offers 9 standard rates across the networks. “Not only does this approach simplify the selection process for our customers, but supercharges the customer application support processes internally too, which means, faster, more efficient service and turnaround time – a win/win scenario in an age of instant gratification,” said Calvin Collett, MD for Supersonic. Collett said he does not believe in participating in a price war with other operators as it leads to a compromise on the quality of the network. “We just don’t believe that dropping our prices will be able to sustain the business nor the industry, so we need to be realistic about our margins that are able to support and grow the network plus consistently improve our service levels.”  Read: MTN reveals new premium packages offering more data
