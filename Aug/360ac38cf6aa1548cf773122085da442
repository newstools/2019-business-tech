Openview has expanded its content offering to include a live sports channel. In a statement on Thursday (8 August), the free satellite service provider said it will be broadcasting the English Premier League on its newly established ‘News&Sports’ channel with matches being broadcast until the end of the season. Openview said the matches will primarily include one of the top six Premier League football clubs each week. Teams will include Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Manchester United. Together with the live matches, eMedia Investments said it has the rights to schedule other football-related magazine programmes that are produced by the Premier League. “This is a momentous addition for us, and for the free-to-air television-watching public,” said COO of eMedia Investments. “A leading brand of sport continues in the free-to-air domain and we, at Openview, are excited to host it. “eMedia will add its very own touch to this broadcast, and hopefully in time, will be able to add more sports offerings on to our bouquet,” he said.
