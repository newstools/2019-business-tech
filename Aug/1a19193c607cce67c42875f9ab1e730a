A rare piece of land in Camps Bay is up for sale, with the plot expected to fetch close to R18 million. According to real estate company Pam Golding Properties, the stand is 908 square metres and offers uninterrupted views. Located in a cul-de-sac, the property also borders the Table Mountain Nature Reserve – offering privacy and access to the beach. The property is also incredibly rare as there have been just 21 plot sales in Camps Bay in the past 10 years, with available land for new developments extremely hard to come by. “There’s considerable demand for vacant land in Camps Bay, from buyers who want to custom design their ideal home,” said Barbara Rogers, Pam Golding Properties area specialist. “The demand for homes in this prestigious suburb means that house prices remain robust, making a plot or a home purchase in this competitive market a sound investment.” Rogers said that the area is popular with tourists but also ideal for family living, as Camps Bay offers a coastal lifestyle with a host of amenities and attractions. “While the city centre, V&A Waterfront and other shopping hubs are nearby, Camps Bay itself offers plenty in the way of entertainment – from the bustling beach strip with its upmarket restaurants and nightspots to the myriad of outdoor activities that range from hiking to surfing,” she said. The asking price for the property is R17.99 million (excluding VAT).   Read: One of the rarest pieces of land in South Africa is up for auction
