Gumtree has published the shortlist for its 2019 pre-owned car awards. The awards include 12 different categories, from budget city cars to luxury SUVs, and include five finalists as selected by a panel of expert judges. The judging criteria include interior quality, standard features, durability, performance, both fuel and maintenance economy, and resale value. Only 2017 models with at least six months of depreciation data were considered. “These are real-world awards for the cars that most South Africans buy using the factors that truly matter to them,” said Gumtree Autos’ Jeff Osborne. “There’s a wide range of brands in every category shortlist with the Hatchbacks and the SUVs being the most tightly contested.” The winners will be announced on 29 October at a gala event in Johannesburg.
