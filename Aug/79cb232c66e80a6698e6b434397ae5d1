Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba has published a list of the most dangerous roads in and around Johannesburg. Presenting accidents statistics for July 2019, Mashaba said at least 41 people died on the city’s roads over the month period. “The below performance is from our register in the JMPD. The fatalities include drivers, passengers pedestrians and cyclists. “This excludes serious accidents where the injured may (have) succumbed to their injuries within 30 days in hospital or so and may be added to the stats, which may explain a difference in national statistics.” Mashaba said that the most dangerous roads include: Region A: Cedar road and Spencer road; Region B: Nasrec road and N17; Region C: Elias Motsoaledi road, Malibongwe drive, and President Fouche drive; Region D: Klipsruit valley road and Moroka Nancefield road; Region E: N1 and William Nicol drive; Region F1: Claim street and Ockerse street; Region F2: M1 South between Xavier and Nasrec road; Region G:  N12 East and Abubaker Asvat; N1  North between Eikenhof bridge and N12 split. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), road crashes exert a heavy burden on the economy, society and families as they involve economically active members of society, many of whom are breadwinners and heads of families. A study conducted by the corporation as well as the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has estimated that the cost of crashes to South Africa last year was R166.2 billion. It is estimated that one death on the road represents an average loss of R4.6 million to the economy in terms of lost productivity, pain and suffering, medical costs, legal and funeral costs.
