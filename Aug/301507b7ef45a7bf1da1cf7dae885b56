Thirteen universities from South Africa feature in the 2019-2020 list of the top 2000 universities compiled by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR). They are led by the University of Cape Town, ranked 252nd globally, and followed by the University of the Witwatersrand, which lost its top spot in SA to UCT in 2018. Stellenbosch University, University of KwaZulu-Natal, and University of Pretoria round up the top five universities in South Africa, with the University of Johannesburg ranked sixth. Stellenbosch climbed from 5th in 2018 to third in 2019, pushing UKZN to fourth and University of Pretoria to fifth. According to the CWUR, results have been mixed for local universities in 2019 with four of the top seven institutions, including the  top two, losing ground. Dr. Nadim Mahassen, president of the  Center for World University Rankings, said: “It is a worrying time for  South African universities amid stiff global competition from well-funded universities. “Funding for higher education is crucial if the government aspires its universities to compete on the global stage. Without sustained strong investment, South African universities face the possibility of declining in the future.”
