South African job seekers do not need an income tax reference number when applying to be considered for job interviews, says SARS. In a statement on Friday (16 August), the revenue collector said that while it will readily assist persons who approach its offices to register, such processes are putting unnecessary strain on both the prospective employees and its branches. “It is important to note that SARS does not require a person to have a tax number when they are employed for the first time. “We provide a variety of easy processes to register your employees for Income Tax, which do not require them to visit a SARS branch.” SARS said that the available processes to register your employees are: SARS e@syFile employer (‘Individual ITREG’) using employee registration; or
Bundled registration (“Bundled ITREG”) available on e@syFile employer allowing you to register up to 100 employees at a time but limited to 1,000 employees per month;
When registered as an organisation, employers can register individual employees on eFiling. When registered as a tax practitioner a file upload option is available in Excel or CSV file format on eFiling. “We encourage you to utilise these options to streamline the process of obtaining income tax numbers for employees,” SARS said.
