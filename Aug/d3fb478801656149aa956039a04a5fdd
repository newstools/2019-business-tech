Data analytics group Lightstone has published a new report showing which petrol station brands have the largest presence in South Africa. The report is based on data from Trackers installed in half a million vehicles, providing insights on the movements and choices of South African motorists. Lightstone has also captured locations of most of the services station landscape, around 4,027 service stations, which highlights that the South African service station landscape is dominated (93% of all outlets) by six brands. The data shows that Engen has the largest network in the country with just under a thousand stations across South Africa.  It is followed by Caltex (683 stations) and Shell (637) stations. Lesser-known brands that still have a relatively larger national footprint include Puma with 114 outlets, Exel with 59 outlets and Ener-Gi with a network of 25 service stations across the country.  Lightstone found that although roughly half of the service stations are in non-metro areas, only 38% of the vehicles (aged between 0 & 15 years) ‘live’ in non-metro areas. “This is likely to be because the role of service stations in non-metro areas is two-fold: partly to service the non-metro based cars, but they also need to be able to service the large bulk of metro based cars as they travel through non-metro areas during long-distance travel.” said Linda Reid, head of commercial property at Lightstone. “Interestingly, this relationship doesn’t hold true for township areas,” she said. “Overall, around 12% of the cars on the road (between 0 & 15 years old) are found in township areas, and the ratio of service stations to vehicles is equal in both non-metro and metro township areas.” Read: Here is the expected petrol price for September
