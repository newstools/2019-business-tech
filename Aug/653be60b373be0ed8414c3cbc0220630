They want to be close to the city centre, close enough to walk, bike, or rely on public transportation,” said Kruger. Kruger said that 1 Albert Road is also located on the MyCiti bus route and with an Uber point at its doorstep.  “Woodstock is undergoing an urban renewal with many exciting new buildings, as well as new businesses moving into the area, making it a hip and happening neighbourhood that is filled with plenty of interesting places and people,” he said. Construction on 1 On Albert is expected to be completed by December 2020. Read: More than 30 developments are in the pipeline for Cape Town’s CBD
