Motorists are choosing to avoid the Western Cape’s N2 highway due to an increase in hijackings, stone-throwing and even petrol bombs. Speaking to 702, provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said that the stretch of highway between the Cape Metro to Sir Lowry’s Pass remains a problem area. He said that there have also been incidents from around the Gordon’s Bay turn-off down to Somerset West. To combat these issues, Africa said that his traffic department is currently working with security companies to patrol the affected areas on a 24/7 basis. He said that these companies are patrolling the highway free of charge in an effort to make the area safer, and there has been a notable decline in the number of incidents since their introduction last week. Despite these protective measures, Africa said that drivers should still take precautions when travelling on the highway. “When you are on the N2 between Somerset West and Cape Town always make sure that there are people driving in front of you,” he said. “Just follow the people, and don’t try and pass them. Rather stay with other motorists on the road so that if there are problems you can stop and assists them.” He said that motorists should also familiarise themselves with the province’s emergency helplines should they run into issues.
