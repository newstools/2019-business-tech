The Volkswagen Polo and Polo Vivo are two of the most popular cars in South Africa, consistently topping monthly sales charts. For the full 2018 calendar year, the Polo was marginally the better selling vehicle – beating the cheaper Polo Vivo by some 2,471 units. However, the tables are turned when it comes to resale value in South Africa, according to Darryl Jacobson, managing director of True Price. True Price attends vehicle repossession auctions each week in order to gather pertinent data. Its team records actual prices paid on auction. To provide accurate resale values for the Polo versus the Polo Vivo, the True Price team analysed its data and then came up with resale values. “While the difference between the two vehicles is far from massive, there is a clear winner in the resale value stake: the Polo Vivo,” said Jacobson. “It delivers a resale value of 70.66%, versus the Polo at 67.62%. This is quite incredible. It shows the power of the less expensive model and is pure economy in action. “The Polo may be the better vehicle, but – right now, in South Africa – affordability rules. This is undoubtedly the reason why the Polo Vivo comes up trumps,” he said. Read: New Volkswagen T-Cross – South African pricing and release dates
