FNB says it is planning to expand tap-and-PIN technology at its ATMs, targeting 600 more machines with the capability over the next year. The group launched a trial for the technology on 100 machines in 2018, which will bring the new total to 700. Customers have the option of making contactless payments using FNB Pay on the group’s banking app, or any supported ‘Pay’ wallets – including Samsung, Fitbit and Garmin. In addition, the new Scan to Pay feature on the FNB App enables customers to perform digital payments by scanning almost any QR Code in SA. Tap-and-PIN uses Near Field Communication (NFC) to allow customers to tap their contactless cards against the NFC reader before entering a PIN. After tapping the card, the transaction continues without the card ever leaving the customer’s hand and this reduces the risk of related fraud, FNB said. Currently, Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal and the Western Cape have the largest device footprint of FNB ATMs that are contactless enabled. However, the planned expansion will cover most parts of the country and the key sites will be announced in due course, the bank said. Read: You can now order medicine from Dis-Chem through the FNB app
