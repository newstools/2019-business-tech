In 1999 the average price for a house and a car were almost the same in South Africa, but 20 years later they are vastly different. New data from research and analytics group Lightstone shows exactly how average prices in these two markets have changed over the last two decades. Between 1999 and 2002, the average prices for houses and cars stuck close to each other, increasing from R108,262 in 1999 to around R165,000 in 2002 – before the housing market prices accelerated greatly. By 2009, average property prices were around double the average car price (R480,000 vs R240,000). At the end of 2018, the average house prices was 2.5 times greater than the average car price (R918,914 vs R369,948), Lightstone’s data showed.  “Comparing property and vehicle prices from 1999 to 2018, it is peculiar to see the cost of these two assets essentially on par in 1999. Fast forward to 2018 where an average priced property is almost 2.5 times more expensive than a new vehicle,” said Lightstone’s Heinrich Coetzee. “This finding is largely attributed to supply and demand, where properties have become sound investments and vehicles lose their value fairly quickly,” he said. He said that more properties were sold at a cheaper price point in 1999 compared to fewer properties sold at a higher price point in 2018. According to Coetzee, although the data would need to be segmented according to the different types of buyers of the market, it can be assumed that the shift in purchasing behaviour over the last 10 years can be ascribed to the economic pressure the middle segment of the market faces. “(This) wouldn’t necessarily affect the higher end of the market that continue to purchase property at higher price points,” Coetzee said. Automotive industry Lightstone’s data showed that while the motoring industry has seen significant changes over the last two decades, there have been several focus areas that have shown only slight variations. New vehicle dealers in South Africa reflected an upward trend from a base of 1,600 dealers in 1999 to 2,100 dealers in 2014, but then declined to 1,700 in 2018. Dealerships have declined during the same period from 450 in 1999 to 350 in 2018. Over the last twenty years, brands have also aggressively increased their number of model variations, body shapes and vehicle brand entries into the market. “With the increase in the number of vehicle brands over the past 20 years, it is to be expected that the vehicle models will also increase exponentially. New vehicle sales experienced a slight increase in 2007 – 2008 before the international financial crisis which resulted in a global and local recession,” Lightstone said. The commercial market peaked in 2009 – 2010 when South Africa played host to the Soccer World Cup where the demand for trade vehicles increased. Read: The best areas in Joburg for property growth
