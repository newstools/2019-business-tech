Earlier this year, the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa officially introduced a new 5-star premium rating. According to the council, the introduction of the new grading level above the 5-star level was in response to a widespread comparative study completed as part of the grading system review process. A number of similar global quality assurance bodies have made the move to recognise and differentiate those products which exhibit a unique level of product quality, extensive guest amenities and world-class luxury service standards. “South Africa prides itself for being a tourism destination that has a variety of products catering for various traveler needs and affordability, said Darryl Erasmus, chief quality assurance officer at the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa. “Much time and energy has gone into setting grading standards that have the traveller’s needs at the centre. This helps maintain South Africa’s global competitiveness as a tourist destination.” Below BusinessTech looked at some of the South African hotels which have been awarded this 5-star premium grading: Lion Sands Ivory Lodge – Mpumalanga      Cape Town’s The Silo Hotel – Western Cape  Hermanus’ Birkenhead House – Western Cape  Royal Malewane Lodge – Mpumalanga    Read: 9 awesome countries South Africans can visit visa-free in 2019
