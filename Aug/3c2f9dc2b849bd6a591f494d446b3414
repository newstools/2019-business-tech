Momentum Metropolitan (formerly MMI Holdings) has announced the appointment of two new chief executives for its corporate and health businesses. Dumo Mbethe has been appointed as chief executive of Momentum Corporate, with effect from 16 September 2019. Mbethe joined the group in January 2017 and was appointed as the chief executive of the Africa business in October 2017, a position he will vacate following this appointment. Hannes Viljoen has been appointed as chief executive of Momentum Metropolitan Health, with effect from 1 September 2019. Viljoen joined the Group in 2003 and has been responsible for the Group’s South African Health interests since June 2016. The appointments come as Momentum Metropolitan embark on a new “reset and grow” strategy, which saw the group drop the MMI Holdings brand in favour of a new identity that leverages its two strongest entities. Born from a merger of Momentum and Metropolitan in 2010, MMI Holdings became one of South Africa’s largest insurance companies listed on the JSE. Under the new name, the group aims to give more exposure to the individual brands, while also demonstrating to investors what the listed company represents. The names of the various businesses carrying the Momentum and Metropolitan brands respectively, including any policies, memberships, agreements and investments, remain unchanged. Their individual brand entities Momentum and Metropolitan stay as they are. The group continues to include specialist companies such as Guardrisk, Exponential and Eris Property Group.
