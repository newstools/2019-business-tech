Cinema chain Ster-Kinekor has taken its ‘Subscription Club’ – a service that will enable customers to watch unlimited movies for a monthly fee – to six additional theatres, following an initial launch in May. Memberships will be available at Sandton City, Cresta, Brooklyn Commercial, Brooklyn Nouveau, Gateway Theatre of Shopping and Blue Route Mall, as well as Eastgate, Watercrest Mall, I’Langa, Somerset Mall and Garden Route Mall, the group said. Members can choose between a Fan Club membership at R249 per month, with 4 movie tickets per month to use with their family (2D or 3D movies only), as well as a 20% discount on a regular combo with each movie ticket. (A regular combo includes 1 medium popcorn, 1 medium soda and a choice of 1 sweet, subject to availability). The other option is to subscribe to the Ster-Kinekor Movies Club, where they get up to 5 movie tickets a day (2D or 3D only), with 20% off a regular combo with each movie ticket, for R349 per month. Ster-Kinekor owns some 60-65% of the local cinema market – 55 movie complexes (more than 400 screens and 64 000 seats), including 154 3D cinemas.
