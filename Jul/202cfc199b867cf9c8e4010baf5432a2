Social media has been overrun with pictures of people making themselves look older using the cloud-processed filters of an app called FaceApp. While some controversy has sparked over privacy concerns around the app, its popularity has also opened the door for malicious groups who are creating fake versions that pose a greater risk to your privacy, data and security. Security firm Kaspersky has warned mobile users following the “ageing app” trend to be wary of a fake version of the app that is loading devices with malware. The group said that it has identified a fake application that is designed to trick users into thinking it is a certified version of FaceApp but goes on to infect victims’ devices with an adware module called MobiDash. “Once the application is downloaded from unofficial sources and installed, it simulates a failure and is subsequently removed. After that, a malicious module in the application rests discreetly on the user’s device, displaying adverts,” the group said. According to Kaspersky data, around 500 unique users have encountered the problem in the last two days, with the first detections appearing on July 7th. There were almost 800 different module modifications identified. “The people behind MobiDash often hide their adware module under the guise of popular applications and services. This means that the activities of the fake version of FaceApp could intensify, especially if we are talking about hundreds of targets in just a few days. “We urge users not to download applications from unofficial sources and to install security solutions on their devices to avoid any damage,” said Igor Golovin, security researcher at Kaspersky.
