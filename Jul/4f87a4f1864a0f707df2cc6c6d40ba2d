Google has updated its Translate app with camera support for 60 more languages – including Afrikaans. While the app supports Sesotho, Xhosa and Zulu translations, the camera feature was not working with these languages at the time of writing. This brings the total number of supported languages in the app to over 100, the company said in a blogpost on Wednesday (10 July). Instant camera translation allows users to see the world in their own language by just pointing your camera lens at the foreign text. Google said that this feature is especially helpful when you’re travelling abroad as it works even when you’re not connected to Wi-Fi or using cellular data.  While previously users could only translate between English and other languages, the update will also allow users to translate into any of the 100+ languages supported on the app. Other new features added to the app include: Automatically detect the language – When travelling abroad, especially in a region with multiple languages, it can be challenging for people to determine the language of the text that they need to translate; Better translations powered by Neural Machine Translation – This produces more accurate and natural translations, reducing errors by 55-85% in certain language pairs. And most of the languages can be downloaded onto your device, so that you can use the feature without an internet connection; A new look – Google said That it has reduced flickering, making the text more stable and easier to understand. The new look has all three camera translation features conveniently located on the bottom of the app. You can download Google Translate the app here.
