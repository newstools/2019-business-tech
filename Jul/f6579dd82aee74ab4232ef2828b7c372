Whether travelling for business or pleasure, hotel guests expect the same conveniences they have at home, from plush bedding to always-on Wi-Fi. In today’s internet driven era, Wi-Fi has become a key deciding factor when selecting holiday accommodation. It has become standard that Wi-Fi offered by hotels must be fast, easy-to-access and also allow guests to stream internet content to any device. Not only will the Wi-Fi be beneficial to the guests, but also offers support to other services in the hotels such as VoIP, TV services over IP, and other smart applications.
