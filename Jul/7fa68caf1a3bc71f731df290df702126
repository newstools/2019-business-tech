Since the Department of Home Affairs started digitising the identity applications process some 13 million smart ID cards have been issued. Speaking to media ahead of his department’s budget vote speech on Wednesday (10 July), Home Affairs deputy minister Njabulo Nzuza said that the improvements in the turnaround times of issuing smart ID cards and modernised passports was due to the roll out of the live capture system. This means that the department now issues a smart ID card within a week and a passport in 13 working days, he said. “This is an improvement compared with the previous waiting period of six months for an ID and four months for a passport. “However, we acknowledge that there are serious blockages in terms of service quality at offices, as evidenced in our interactions with citizens while visiting various front offices since we assumed office.” Nzuza added that it is currently a ‘ministerial priority’ to reduce long waiting periods at front offices. “The department will use the budget vote to acknowledge the work that is being done to clean the national population register,” he said, “Nzuza said this will be done by strengthening the early birth registration programme and fighting fraudulent marriages.” Read: A large number of South Africans have applied for a second passport – here’s who is leaving and where they are going
