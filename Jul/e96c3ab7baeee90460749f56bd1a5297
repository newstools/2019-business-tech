President Ramaphosa presented his speech at South Africa’s first Digital Economy Summit via hologram. Speaking at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand on Friday (5 July), Ramaphosa’s address was simultaneous broadcast as a holographic image to the Rustenburg Civic Centre, the Department of Telecommunications. Ramaphosa used the address to talk on the establishment of the new Fourth Industrial Commission and the importance of technology to South Africa’s future. According to the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS) this is the first live holographic broadcast of a Head of State. A 3D hologram is a projection that exists freely in space and is visible without the need for 3D glasses. It displays products, objects, and animated sequences three-dimensionally and enables seemingly real objects or animations to appear to float completely freely in space.
