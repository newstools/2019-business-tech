YouTube has released a statement clearing up confusion around its recent announcement that it would be bringing ‘live’ sports content to South Africans via the video platform. In the original statement, YouTube said that it had partnered with SuperSport and NBA Africa to bring fans live sporting events, including the 2019 NBA Finals, Women’s World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, UEFA Champions and Europa leagues, ABSA Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A. However, Supersport denied any partnership with YouTube over its content, saying that its live streaming policy on YouTube is focused on youth and emerging sport with none of the traditional rights holders involved at all. “This would be in conflict with our broadcast arrangements,” it said. Supersport’s response led to YouTube reissuing the press release removing all mention of the sports broadcaster, before retracting the release completely. This left many viewers confused about what exactly was being offered by YouTube in terms of sports content.
