Consulta has released its latest South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SA-csi), showing which clothing stores have the highest customer satisfaction ratings. The index ranks Ackermans, Edgars, Jet, Mr. Price, Pep Stores, Truworths and Woolworths based on highly scientific insights into the overall level of satisfaction of customers. Pep Stores leads the clothing store rankings with 79.8 on overall customer satisfaction score, followed closely by Truworths (79.5) and Ackermans (79.2). Woolworths (78.9) and Jet (77.5) follow on industry par (77.9), while Mr. Price (76) and Edgars (74.7) are missing the mark when it comes to keeping customers satisfied and loyal to their brands.  The report shows that while all clothing stores are meeting customer expectations, there is little differentiation and none are raising the bar on superior customer experiences. As consumers increasingly look for value, quality and ease of shopping as economic conditions bite, even seemingly luxury brands riding on a ‘quality’ ticket are finding that customers increasingly question the link between perceived quality and perceived value, and whether the pay-off justifies it. “Dreary results have been coming through from South Africa’s major listed clothing stores as local market conditions, increasing competition from international brands and rapidly changing consumer preferences culminate to bite into their bottom line,” said SA-csi founder and chairperson, Professor Adré Schreuder “Edgars has been through the mill in recent months in terms of its dire financial position, while Woolworths has taken a number of big reputational hits in the court of public opinion with regard to alleged copyright infringements with small businesses. “It is likely that these highly publicised events also played a role in how consumers relate to the brands and there is much work needed to restore the trust deficit,” he said.
