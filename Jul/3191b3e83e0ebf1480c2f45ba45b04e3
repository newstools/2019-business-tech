The Department of Defence and Military Veterans has warned that a severe lack of funding could impact its ability to protect South Africa. In a media briefing on Wednesday (17 July), Defence minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said that her department has been forced to continuously adjust its plans downwards in response to the declining budget in recent years. “The Defence Force is becoming progressively more unsustainable in terms of declining defence allocations,” she said. “We have now reached the point where the Republic must decide on the kind of Defence Force it wants and what it can afford. We need a frank discussion very soon as we risk the irreversible damage to the defence force as a whole.” In a portfolio committee meeting held earlier this month, the department said that the continued lack of funding may impact negatively on the ability of the SANDF to fulfil its constitutional mandate. It added that over the past three financial years insufficient funds were available to cover expenditure related to compensation of employees. This had led to the Department of Defence exploring additional sources of revenue, such as the sale of assets (including land), to cover the shortfall. Declining force One of the key issues that was raised during the committee meeting was the protection of South Africa’s borders. Specific concerns raised included: That the current deployment of 15 SANDF sub-units along South Africa’s borders are insufficient and that at least 22 sub-units are required.
The need for technological force multipliers to assist deployed forces along the land borders.
Shortages of suitable air assets at the SA Air Force’s 35 Squadron as well as 28 Squadron to effect border patrols. Other issues identified include: The replacing of South Africa’s infantry fighting vehicles with a modern fleet;
Challenges with the SANDF’s Logistical support to operational equipment – specifically the need for aircraft spares;
Outdated ICT systems, notably the finance, human resources and logistics systems.
