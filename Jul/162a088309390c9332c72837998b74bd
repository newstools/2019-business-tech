South African taxpayers eager to get their refund for 2019 may not have to wait very long – provided there are no issues identified by the taxman. The South African Revenue Service (SARS) explained to BusinessTech that a refund for a current year personal income tax return will be paid out only once the tax return has been risk assessed and where no risk has been detected. “In such a case, the turnaround time for the refund to be paid out is 7 days,” it said. “In a case where a risk was detected and there is a requirement for additional information or validation of information such as personal details, any refund due would be processed once the requested information was received and the assessment finalised.” The tax body said that it has been encouraged by a positive uptake in the number tax returns submitted via eFiling already. It said that over half a million individuals logged on in the first two days – of whom 297,488 requested their return and 188,140 filed. Read: When you are not required to file a tax return
