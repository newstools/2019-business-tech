Public Enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan has appointed Jabu Mabuza as the interim executive chairman for Eskom, and acting chief executive officer (CEO) of Eskom Holdings. In May, Eskom’s board announced that Eskom Group CEO Phakamani Hadebe would step down at the end of July 2019. “I have informed the Eskom Annual General Meeting (AGM) this afternoon of my decision to appoint Mr Jabu Mabuza as the Interim Executive Chairman for Eskom and Acting CEO of Eskom Holdings. “Mr Mabuza will assume the duty as acting group chief executive officer (GCEO) for Eskom due to the resignation of Mr Phakamani Hadebe, who leaves Eskom on 31 July 2019. “Within the three month period during which Mr Mabuza will be the executive chairman and acting CEO, the Eskom board will conclude the process of identifying a suitable candidate to become the next Eskom GCEO,” Gordhan said. The appointment comes as Eskom is set to announce its second consecutive multi-billion rand annual loss on Tuesday. The state-owned utility forecast in January that its loss would widen to about R20 billion in the year through March, from R2.3 billion the year before, Bloomberg reported.
