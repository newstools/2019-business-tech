The Department of Public Service and Administration has published its latest salary scales for public sector workers, showing how much they will be earning in 2019. The new salaries took effect from 1 April 2019, based on the outcomes of protracted wage negotiations with government in 2018. In 2018 the Public Servants Collective Bargaining Council (PSCBC) secured a 6% to 7% increase for workers in the sectors it covers, along with increases for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 years, based on forward CPI projections from National Treasury. According to a circular published in March 2019, the projected CPI for 2019/20 is at 5.2%, which means public servants can expect increases ranging from 5.2% to 6.2%, depending on their job level. Among the jobs listed in the salary document, nearly 50 carry high earning power – pulling in more than R1 million a year, depending on grade and pay level. Unsurprisingly, most of these are in the medical and technical fields (such as engineering), or various management positions across most departments. High-paying public sector jobs can be split into two categories – those that have a starting salary of R1 million or more, and those that have lower starting salaries, but the potential to reach over R1 million a year with time and experience. Starting at R1 million or more The jobs that start out paying R1 million a year are those that require specialist or technical skills in a specific field. Medical officers in general are well paid in the public sector, but the salaries listed below also apply for those specialising in dentistry, pharmacology and stomatology (indicated with a *). Potential for R1 million The jobs listed below show the highest earning potential for the respective occupations. While starting salaries are below the R1 million mark, the jobs do pay that kind of salary at the highest levels. Read: Government is out of cash: report
