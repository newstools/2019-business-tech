Our audience is constantly looking for sports content on YouTube,” said YouTube content partnerships lead Dayo Olopade. “In 2018, we saw a 70% increase of views in Sports & Fitness content on YouTube across Europe, the Middle East and Africa with content garnering more than 61 billion views. “Today we are here to say we hear you and we are more than happy to bring you the content you desire, in partnership with SuperSport, NBA Africa and our other partners.” Olopade said that South Africans can now watch NBA basketball fixtures, La Liga 123 matches and UFC matches live on YouTube, while the remaining sporting events will be pre-packaged video on demand.
