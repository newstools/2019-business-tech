Diversified financial services group Vunani Limited has become the latest company to launch a secondary listing on South Africaâ€™s newest stock exchange, A2X Markets. A2X is a licensed stock exchange which provides a secondary listing venue for companies, having begun trading in October 2017. The bourse is the third to start operations in South Africa, after ZAR X broke the JSE monopoly in 2014. It has nine approved brokers that account for about 50% of market activity, and is regulated by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority and the Prudential Authority (SARB) in terms of the Financial Markets Act. With the addition of Vunani, the stock exchange now lists 26 companies, with a combined market capitalisation of R2.443 trillion. The group has listings from companies in key sectors including media, mining, banking, retail, FMCG, financial services, insurance, healthcare and telecommunications. Naspers is the biggest group listed, with a market cap of R1.52 trillion. This is followed by Standard Bank with a market cap of R307.3 billion, and Sanlam at R178.4 billion.
