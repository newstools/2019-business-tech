Johannesburg residents will pay more for their municipal rates from Monday 1 July 2019 as the city’s new increases take effect. According to the city’s 2019/2020 tariff reports, some of the most notable increases include: A 9.9% increase in the cost of water;
A 5.5% increase in property rates;
A 13.07% increase in electricity;
A 7% increase in refuse removal (solid waste). The municipal rate increases come as South Africans face financial pressure after months of petrol price increases, job cuts, and a battered economy. The one silver lining is a drop in the petrol price from Wednesday, 3 July 2019. Petrol is set to decline by 95 cents and 96 cents per litre for 95 and 93 grades, respectively. Diesel will come down by 75 cents and 76 cents per litre for 0.05% sulphur content and 0.005% sulphur content, respectively. Member of the Mayoral Committee for Finance in the City of Johannesburg, Funzela Ngobeni, told the SABC that the National Energy Regulator of South Africa’s (NERSA) decision to grant Eskom a more than 41% tariff increase has forced the city to hike its tariffs. He said that the city’s electricity tariff will rise from an originally proposed 12.20%, to 13.07% across all categories on Monday. You can find a more detailed breakdown of the tariff hikes here.
