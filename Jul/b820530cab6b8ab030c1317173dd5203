Shoprite has published its operational update for the year ending 30 June 2019, detailing its financials and the new updates they are bringing to their stores. Excluding hyperinflation seen in some of its African operations, the group said that it increased total turnover by 3.2% to approximately R150.6 billion in the period to June 2019. The group’s core business, Supermarkets RSA, achieved 4.9% sales growth for the period with an improved second half in which sales increased by 7.4% on the back of better customer and volume growth, as well as an improvement in on-shelf availability and promotional effectiveness. “The Checkers chain led the supermarkets’ growth, making strides in improving our fresh offer and gaining market share in fresh produce and convenience meals,” Shoprite said. “The accelerated rollout of our new FreshX concept stores is showing exceptional performance.”  FreshX First launched at Johannesburg’s Mall of Africa in 2017, the FreshX concept stores have now been rolled out to a number of Checkers locations including Canal Walk and Fourways. The concept stores were introduced by Checkers as a way for the company to gain market share among more affluent South Africans, with the idea proving so popular that the group now plans to revamp at least a third of its Checkers stores to the new look in the medium term. Unlike traditional Checkers stores, the FreshX concept stores feature more upmarket furniture and signage – including benches and tables for customers to test samples.  The stores still include the deli, cheese and wine sections seen in traditional Checkers stores, but the selection on offer is greatly increased and presented in a more modern way. They also include a number of non-food sections for electronics and outdoor equipment. All images sourced from The Design Company. Read: These are the best clothing stores in South Africa
