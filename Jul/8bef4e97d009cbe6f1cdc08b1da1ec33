People rarely carry cash anymore, which is why leading parking providers have partnered with mobile payments app, SnapScan, to provide their customers with a convenient way to pay. This means that instead of frantically looking around for an ATM when you need to pay your parking ticket, all you have to do is snap out your phone and pay. This solution was first rolled out in Cape Town CBD and has since been deployed in other areas in the Western Cape, like Stellenbosch. Motorists in Cape Town CBD and Stellenbosch can pay for parking via SnapScan with their phone. Using the app, motorists scan a SnapCode (unique QR code) on the handheld phone that each parking marshal carries. The QR codes change depending on the amount the motorist owes. This amount prepopulates within the app, and once you pay a receipt is automatically printed by the marshal. Another method that SnapScan deploys has been rolled out to Seapoint, Claremont, Bellville, Strand, Somerset West, and Paarl, and can be found within the app when selecting the “more” button. Using this method, motorists can add their car’s vehicle registration number within the app, and this turns their phones into a virtual parking meter.  SnapScan has said that there are a range of mobile payment solutions available for parking service providers, from simple static QR codes displayed at gates of parking lots, to more sophisticated integrations with parking software. Regardless of the solution, motorists’ experiences are changing for the better. SnapScan’s parking payment solutions will soon be rolled out to other areas in the country, especially in malls and parking lots. “We are always looking for new partnerships to make paying for parking more convenient for people across the country,” SnapScan said.
