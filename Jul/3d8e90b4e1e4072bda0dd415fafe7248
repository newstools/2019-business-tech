In line with international trends and following on the success of Black Friday, Takealot Group – including both Takealot.com and Superbalist – is launching a first-of-its-kind shopping event in South Africa. The ‘Ultimate Checkout Sale’ is the Takealot Group’s beginnings of creating a South African version of an annual shopping event akin to those already established in the USA, China and India. “The year on year growth of Black Friday is an excellent indication of the appetite for big shopping events in South Africa,” said Kim Reid, Takealot Group CEO. “Internationally, annual events such as Amazon’s Prime Day, Alibaba’s Singles Day and Flipkart’s Big Billion Days highlight the demand for tailored shopping experiences in addition to great deals. “What makes The Ultimate Checkout different is that it is built on shopper behaviour and we are hoping to establish this as an annual event.” The group said that the Ultimate Checkout deals are based on analysis of behaviour and trends of over 1.7-million shoppers on Takealot (online general retail) and Superbalist (fashion and homeware). This shopper-centric approach focuses on the highest-rated, most searched for, and most wish-listed products. The Ultimate Checkout will kick off at 00:01 on 24 July and run as follows: 24 July – Day 1: Deals on highest rated products
25 July – Day 2: Deals on most searched for products + highest rated products
26 July – Day 3: Deals on most wish-listed products + most searched for products + highest rated products Read: Who is Naspers’ new CEO?
