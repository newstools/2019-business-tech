Telkom will discontinue its copper-based fixed-line prepaid service from August. In an emailed statement on Wednesday (31 July), the company said that it has already upgraded over 96% of its prepaid fixed-line customers to wireless prepaid service in a bid to improve customer experience. “Telkom’s wireless service is more reliable than its copper-based technology and is less susceptible to interruptions as a result of adverse weather conditions, faults and cable theft,” it said. “Based on the success of the upgrades, Telkom is now ready to discontinue its legacy copper-based fixed line prepaid service platform and will do so with effect from 1 August 2019.” Over and above the customer benefit and service improvements, Telkom said that this upgrade supports its overall strategic objective to decommission and replace its legacy copper technology. Telkom first announced the transition from copper-based technology to wireless in 2015 noting that the migration would be done as a phased approach. “Having successfully migrated over 96% of prepaid fixed line customers, Telkom is now migrating postpaid fixed copper-based voice and / or DSL customers to fibre and wireless,” it said. “The service is gaining momentum with customers who’ve respond well to the SmartVoice, SmartBroadband Wireless and UNLIMITEDhome fibre offerings. “While Telkom aims to have as little interruption as possible during the decommission, customers experiencing issues can report them to Telkom on 10210.” Read: R23 million payday for Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko
