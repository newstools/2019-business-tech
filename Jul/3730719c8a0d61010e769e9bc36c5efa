Naspers performance Naspers has been criticised in the past for making its executive pay schemes opaque, at a time when massive paydays for CEOs and other executives have come under close scrutiny. The company has moved to try and be more clear in tying its remuneration policies into the group’s performance, including detailing the ways executives benefit from significant transactions. For the year ended March 2019, the group reported solid financial results, delivering revenue growth of 29% year on year, to US$19 billion, trading profit growth of 22% year on year to US$3.3 billion, core headline earnings of US$3 billion (up 26% year on year) and free cash flow of US$120 million.

In the Flipkart transaction, CEO Bob van Dijk made a gain of $14.9 million through the share appreciation rights scheme. With Multichoice, both Van Dijk and CFO Basil Sgourdos took an adjusted strike price of their share options rather than delivery of Multichoice Group shares.
