Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation has launched NTT Ltd, a global technology services provider that brings together the capabilities of 28 companies, including NTT Communications, Dimension Data and NTT Security into one US $11 billion business. NTT is headquartered in London, and employs around 40,000 people in offices across 70+ countries and regions. “I’m delighted to announce that we launched NTT Ltd today. When we combine the new capabilities of NTT Ltd along with NTT DATA, we create a top five global technology and business solutions provider with US$20 billion revenues outside of Japan. Going forward, we will accelerate our execution as one NTT in order to contribute to a smarter and better world through digital transformation,” said president and CEO for NTT Corporation, Jun Sawada. Representing NTT within the Middle East and Africa (MEA) territory is Dimension Data MEA, which will retain the Dimension Data brand, along with subsidiary brands Internet Solutions, Merchants and Britehouse. This is due to strong brand equity in the territory, along with no direct NTT presence across the MEA territory. Dimension Data MEA remains a member of NTT Group. Dimension Data will also continue to leverage NTT’s shared services, technology, and platform investments. “This is an important step forward for Dimension Data, which started as a homegrown South African ICT company. We’re so proud to be able to move this brand forwards in the region, while also retaining our strong links with NTT, enabling us to continue to deliver world-class services, technology and expertise,” said Grant Bodley, CEO for Dimension Data MEA.
