MTN has issued a warning about two parody social media accounts – MTN AWOOF Giveaway and MTN Free Dashout – that purport to be official accounts. The telecoms company said that these accounts have not been endorsed by itself or any of its third-party service providers. “These accounts are run by scammers who use them to defraud unsuspecting members of the public,” MTN said. “We wish to strongly urge our customers not to fall prey to these accounts as they are not official and legitimate MTN accounts. Customers who wish to interact with us on social media can do so by using our official platforms which are listed below.” In recent months, MTN said it has seen a growth of parody social media accounts, particularly on Facebook, with some customers receiving friend requests from users claiming to be MTN agents who offer to assist them with their queries privately. “We encourage our customers to be on high alert and when uncertain, to verify the validity of purported MTN social media accounts by calling our call centre on 083 808 or by visiting any MTN retail centre. “Our social media team are in regular contact with Facebook to remove these fake accounts as soon as we become aware of them.” Read: Hawks and FBI take down online dating scam which allegedly stole millions of rands
