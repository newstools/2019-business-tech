Plans to introduce the General Education Certificate (GEC) will be finalised by end of 2019, according to Tourism minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane. Kubayi-Ngubane was presenting at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development at the United Nations on Wednesday (17 July), saying the new qualification will ensure that learners completing Grade 9 will have something to show for it. “This will ensure that learners completing Grade 9 will receive a qualification certificate recognising the completion of General Education and Training Band (GET Band),” she said. “Learners completing Grade 9 will then articulate into FET Band, into TVET Colleges or even into the world of work for those who would choose to do so.” Three-stream model Kubayi-Ngubane said that this new certificate forms part of government’s new ‘Three Stream Model’ which has been developed to address the country’s high dropout and throughput rates. “The current configuration of the curriculum offering only catered for learners who are academically inclined to the disadvantage of learners who are vocationally as well as occupationally gifted,” she said. “The Three Streams Model offers learners three distinct pathways, namely academic, vocational well as occupational pathways, which recognises that learners are differently gifted and that opportunities should be created for each type of gifting.” Kubayi-Ngubane said that the model would also allow for a seamless transition between the schooling sector, world of work and Higher Education Institutions as well as to offer learners an opportunity to complete Grade 9.
