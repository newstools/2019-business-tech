The South African Revenue Service (SARS) says it is aware of a problem that some taxpayers are experiencing while submitting returns through eFiling. The revenue service said that the issue occurs when users try to save their income tax return, and immediately re-open the return and press the tax calculates button before the form has fully rendered. The problem is aggravated when taxpayers click multiple times as they try to view their return. “SARS will be putting in a fix where all the buttons, including the calculate button, will be greyed while the form is still loading. SARS will also limit the clicks on each button to (one click),” it said. The tax body said that it is encouraged by a positive uptake in the number tax returns submitted via eFiling already. It said that over half a million individuals logged on in the first two days – of whom 297,488 requested their return and 188,140 filed. Read: The tax benefits of giving to charity
