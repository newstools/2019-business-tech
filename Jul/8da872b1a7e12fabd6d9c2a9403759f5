South African motorists saw their first fuel price drop of 2019 earlier this week, with petrol and diesel prices coming down quite significantly. However, prices remain near record highs, while applications for vehicle financing trend ever more heavily towards second hand vehicles. But which used vehicle is best? Darryl Jacobson, managing director of True Price, has selected a list of seven cars if fuel economy is the most important factor. “We have gone through our extensive database, and we have picked the top eight vehicles when it comes to both resale value and fuel economy. I believe that South African motorists wanting to reduce their fuel bill would be well advised to consider these vehicles,” he said. Data used by the evaluation company is taken from vehicles that have done between 50,000 and 150,000 km. They were registered in 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Below Jacobson outlined some of the most fuel-efficient cars in the country right now across all of the major price ranges. The resale value is expressed as a percentage of the vehicle’s original retail price. Volkswagen Tiguan 2.0 TDI Comfortline From R505,800
