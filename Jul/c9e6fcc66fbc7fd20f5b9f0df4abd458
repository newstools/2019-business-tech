Yuppiechef opened its first Johannesburg stores on Friday (28 June), with new outlets in Mall of Africa and Sandton City. Yuppiechef CEO Andrew Smith said the two Johannesburg stores represent a new era for the brand. “Since the launch of our first physical store two years ago, and with four Cape Town branches now thriving, we’ve always had Joburg customers asking us when their turn was coming,” said Smith. The company said the new stores will carry a selection of the products available on Yuppiechef’s online store. Should an item not be available in the store, however, customers can order it while visiting the store and have it delivered to their preferred address. “Through the combination of our online and physical stores, our customers have access to a much broader range, bigger than any single store offering,” said Smith.
