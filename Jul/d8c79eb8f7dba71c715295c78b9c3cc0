Minister of Public Service and Administration, Senzo Mchunu, has announced that a new departmental unit will be responsible for conducting lifestyle audits on government employees. Responding in a recent parliamentary Q&A session, Mchunu said that the newly established Public Administration Ethics, Integrity and Disciplinary Technical Assistance Unit will conduct ethics profiles on all employees in the public administration. He said that the mandate of this unit is to: Support and provide technical assistance for the management of ethics, integrity and disciplinary matters relating to misconduct in the public administration;
Develop norms and standards for the above;
Build capacity around the disciplining of misconduct;
Strengthen oversight of ethics, integrity and discipline; and to intervene in cases where systemic weaknesses are identified;
Promote ethics and integrity; and
Cooperate with other institutions and organs of state. “As such, this unit is the legal custodian of all integrity testing information and is responsible for lifestyle audits and integrity testing in all spheres of government,” said Mchunu. He added that the unit is currently incubated in the Depart of Public Service and Administration, with efforts underway to fund and staff it properly, through a process of internal reprioritisation and reorganisation. “The first phase will commence from 1 September 2019, and will include lifestyle audits as a function,” he said.
