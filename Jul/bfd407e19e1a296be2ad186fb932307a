However, it reported issues in the fixed-line business which showed a decline in revenue of 7.9% as customers migrated to new technology. Fixed voice and interconnection revenue declined by 14.3%, which negatively impacted the overall performance of Openserve and BCX. Despite this impact, overall revenue decline was contained at 3.3% for Openserve and 3.4% for BCX, it said. Other key salient features include: Group operating revenue up 5.3% to R41.8 billion
EBITDA up 8.5% to R11.3 billion
Capex of R7.7 billion with capex to revenue ratio of 18.4%
Final ordinary dividend of 249 cents taking the annual dividend to 362 cents, an increase of  2.0% year on year
Headline earnings per share was up 22.6% to 722.4 cents per share. Telkom also shed more than 2,000 permanent jobs over the past year, or 12.5% of its workforce. The operator noted that permanent jobs declined to 15,296 from 17,472 in the prior year – a loss of 2,176 people. “The decrease in permanent workforce was primarily due to VSP’s (voluntary severance package) and VERP’s (voluntary early retirement packages) offered and the section 189 process,” it said.
