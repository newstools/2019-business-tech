In August, the South African Post Office (Sapo) announced that it now accepts debit and credit cards as a payment method for the renewal of motor vehicle licences at select branches. While the announcement was met with general positivity, BusinessTech received a number of complaints from readers indicating that they were unable to use the new functionality. One reader travelled to three separate branches on the same day, with each outlet indicating that the facility was unavailable. Responding to an emailed query from BusinessTech Refilwe Kekana, CIO of the SA Post Office, said that the Sapo had rolled out the service but was currently addressing a number of hiccups. “The SA Post Office has rolled out card payments for MVL at the branches in the list earlier communicated,” he said. “There have been intermittent connectivity issues at a few isolated branches which is being corrected with a hardware renewal program.” Branches According to the Sapo, the renewal of motor vehicle licences is the most popular transaction at post office branches. It added that the ability to pay with cards is available at selected post offices in all provinces except Mpumalanga and the Western Cape. The list of branches where the service is available can be checked here. If motorists have not received a renewal notice, the renewal form (ALV form) can be downloaded online. Motorists who have received a traffic fine issued in terms of the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto) Act may also pay the traffic fine at any SA Post Office countrywide.
