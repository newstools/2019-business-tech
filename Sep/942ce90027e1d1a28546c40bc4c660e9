WPP and Kantar have published a ranking of the 30 most valuable South African brands. The BrandZ study – which combines company financial data with consumer insight and opinion – found that the combined value of the 30 brands is $37.14 billion. Standard Bank was ranked first with a brand value of $3.55 billion, followed closely by First National Bank (FNB), with a value of $3.46 billion. Meanwhile, an 11% increase in value to $846 million saw Capitec Bank (one of only three brands whose value went up) rise three places to 17th. With an overall value of $11.83 billion, the banking sector retains its pole position in the ranking. The fastest riser in the ranking was entertainment brand DStv which increased its value by 38% to $1.07 billion (in part due to DStv’s parent company Multichoice now being listed on the JSE) to rise six places up the ranking to 18th. “By carefully curating content for local audiences, alongside initiatives such as working with South African filmmakers – many of whom are from underprivileged backgrounds, DStv has established itself as a key contributor in creating an exciting, meaningful and sustainable video entertainment industry,” the researchers said. “Difference has proven to be an important factor for South African consumers. “As demonstrated by the banking category, innovative brands that were able to demonstrate their uniqueness were more robust; brands seen to have distinct attributes were 13% better off than those that did not.” Below is the full ranking of South Africa’s top brands: Read: Discovery says its bank has 22,000 clients and is gaining momentum
