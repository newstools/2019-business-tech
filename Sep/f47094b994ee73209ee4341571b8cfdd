Online motoring portal Cars.co.za has announced the semi-finalists of the 2019/20 Cars.co.za Consumer Awards – powered by WesBank. The awards programme recognises the best purchasing propositions in respective categories of the new vehicle market. “Vehicle purchases are amongst the biggest that consumers are likely to make in their lifetime,” said Ghana Msibi, executive head of sales and marketing at WesBank. “Initiatives such as this offer credible opinions on the types of cars and features available in the market, and in so doing help consumers make informed decisions when choosing a new or used vehicle,” he said. The 13 eventual category winners will be selected from the list of 65 vehicles, which includes model derivatives from 24 brands represented in the South African market. All vehicles available on the South African market on September 1, 2019, were eligible, not only new products that were launched during the past 12 months. Compared with the 2018/19 Cars Awards, the executive sedan category has been replaced with one that caters for premium-positioned crossovers. The former Hot Hatch category (now named Fun Hatch) encompasses more affordable contenders and the price caps for the Premium SUV and Performance Car segments have been raised, it said. “It is important to note that we analyse market changes proactively and adapt the categories to be better aligned with the South African consumer,” said Cars.co.za consumer experience manager Hannes Oosthuizen. “With no new contenders in the Executive Sedan category, as well as very poor sales in that segment, we saw it fit to create a new category (to reflect growth and interest in upmarket crossovers) instead. “Meanwhile there have been no new launches in the traditional hot hatch category, but there has been activity at a lower price point, so we’ve created a new category called Fun Hatch.” And given the rapidly rising prices of cars, Oosthuisen said that sticking to a R1-million barrier for Premium SUV and Performance Car categories is no longer practical. Volkswagen leads the charge again Even though 24 brands’ vehicles feature in the list of 65, five marques have more than three semi-finalists in the running for category honours. Volkswagen has the most representatives (8), followed by BMW (6) and Audi, which has 5, although the A1 Sportback 40TFSI S Line is notably a semi-finalist in two separate categories. Ford (5) and Toyota (4) round out the major manufacturers. Full list of 2019/20 semi-finalists: Budget Car Kia Picanto 1.2 Style
