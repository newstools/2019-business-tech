The government spends close to R30 billion in public money to fund the millionaire lifestyles of 27,650 managers in the public service, the Democratic Alliance (DA) says. This expenditure emerged from a series of parliamentary questions asked by the DA over the past few months. “According to the Minister of Public Service and Administration, the government currently spends R7.2 billion per year on middle managers in provincial governments, R6.1 billion on senior managers in provinces, R8.1 billion on middle managers in national government, and R8.3 billion on senior managers in national government,” it said. On average, each of the 9.774 senior managers in national and provincial government takes home R1.4 million per year, with the highest level managers being paid just under R2 million per year, the political party said. It noted that this is in sharp contrast to the average annual salary of R169,466 paid to a police officer, R273,209 paid to teachers, and R302,000 paid to nurses on average, per year. “If the government cut the number of managers in the public service by half, we could immediately hire an additional 175,000 police officers, 54,000 teachers or 49,000 nurses,” said Dr Leon Schreiber , DA shadow minister of public service and administration. “In light of these worrying new figures, the DA reiterates our call for a comprehensive public expenditure review and the eradication of cadre deployment. “The government must urgently rightsize the state by drastically reducing the number of managers in the public service and instead spending those billions on the frontline service delivery workers that create opportunities for citizens to prosper,” he said.
