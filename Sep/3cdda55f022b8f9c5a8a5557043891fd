Ahead of Black Friday 2019, Pick n Pay has announced that it will run a ‘trial run’ on Friday (27 September). The retailer said that the trial will test its new systems and prepare for the influx of customers at the end of November. “For one day only on 27 September, stores across the country will offer Black Friday-inspired deals on some of the most popular everyday products purchased on Black Friday last year,” it said. “The Pick n Pay online shop will also have selected online-only deals. “The Black Friday Trial Run deals will offer discounts of up to 45% across a range of everyday products from fresh foods, non-perishable items, and beverages to nappies, toiletries and household products.” John Bradshaw, retail executive for marketing at Pick n Pay, said its trial run for Black Friday is an opportunity to give customers great deals on their favourite everyday items ahead of Black Friday, and to stress-test its new systems for a ‘bigger and better’ Black Friday this year. “Customers really enjoyed our Black Friday deals last year. This year, we’ll have the best deals and the smoothest and most efficient in-store experience for them,” said Bradshaw. “Last year was Pick n Pay’s biggest Black Friday yet, running in-store and online deals for a full weekend, and weekly online-only Black Friday deals throughout November.” Read: A look at Pick n Pay’s new ‘next-generation’ stores
