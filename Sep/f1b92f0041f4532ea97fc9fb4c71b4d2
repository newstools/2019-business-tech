The highly aspirational nature of GTI models produced by Volkswagen has been reaffirmed by an analysis of the most-searched-for individual variants on AutoTrader. The digital automotive marketplace, which boasts over a million searches per day, uses a comprehensive and structured VIN database serving as a  proxy for the local automotive market demand and supply. According to George Mienie, chief executive officer of AutoTrader, the Volkswagen Golf GTI is currently the most-searched-for variant. It made up almost 3% of total variant searches, he said. The second spot is occupied by the Volkswagen Golf GTI’s sibling, the Volkswagen Polo GTI. It accounted for 2.54% of all searches, which is also remarkable, said Mienie. Rounding off the top three is yet another Volkswagen model. “The third most searched-for individual variant is the Golf R. This is testament to the power of the Volkswagen brand, and a clear indication that the company’s performance models are some of the most desirable’’ Mienie said. Occupying the fourth and fifth spots are two models that, while hailing from the same manufacturer, are quite different vehicles. The Ford Ranger Wildtrak bakkie clocks in at fourth, followed very closely by yet another performance car, the Ford Focus ST. Sixth, seventh and eighth places are all occupied by luxury German cars. In number six is the BMW 320i, followed by the Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG and finally, the BMW 320d. Yet another Ford – the Fiesta ST – clocks in ninth while the Audi S3 2.0 rounds off the top 10.
