The group is awaiting a R3.2 billion cash injection, with aid promised if the board met 11 conditions – which it says it has. Currently the group can only pay salaries, which make up 45% of its total expenditure. [IOL] Despite making a show of ridding government of ‘failed’ politicians, president Cyril Ramaphosa is now reportedly sitting with documents awaiting his signature to send the likes of Bathabile Dlamini and Siyabonga Cwele to other countries as ambassadors – keeping them on government’s payroll. Insiders at Dirco are worried that this will send the wrong message and hamper South Africa’s investment drive.
