Pick n Pay Smart Shoppers can now spend their points for fuel at participating BP service stations across the country. The two entities last year announced their extended partnership, which saw customers being able to earn points through the retailerâ€™s loyalty programme, Smart Shopper, every time they swipe their card when purchasing fuel at BP forecourts. In the first six months since the launch in November 2018, over one million Smart Shoppers earned loyalty points on fuel purchases. Smart Shoppers earn 10 points for every litre of fuel purchased at over 500 BP service stations across South Africa. Customers who have R75 or more in Smart Shopper points can now use these points to pay, or part pay, for their fuel at BP. Similar to shopping at any Pick n Pay store, customers can swipe their Smart Shopper card and spend their points at any pay point at BP forecourts.
