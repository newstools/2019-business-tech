The South African National Space Agency (Sansa) is assembling a team for a summer trip to Antarctica and has opened up applications to the public. The agency said that the trip will stretch from the beginning of December 2019 until the end of February 2020. It added that any interested individuals with some scientific/engineering background may apply. While no payment will be made to these volunteers, Sansa said that all their expenses will be paid, starting from Cape Town. “As the take-over occurs under harsh conditions and hard physical labour has to be executed, candidates must be physically fit and mentally strong,” it said. “Shortlisted applicants will have to undergo a full medical screening, including a dental examination at Sansa’s cost.” Sansa said that background verification, including criminal record, credit checks, security clearances, qualification and citizenship checks, as well as competency assessment and psychometric testing, may also form part of the selection process. More information on the island and human activities there can be found here. How to apply Interested applicants have been asked to e-mail the documents listed below to aengelbrecht@sansa.org.za and cc ameyer@sansa.org.za.
