The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has warned that the planned banking strike on Friday (27 September) may impact some of its tax systems. In a statement on Monday (23 September), the revenue collector said that the anticipated protest action could impact transactions related to tax payments. It added that the processing of tax refunds may also be impacted on the day. “The South African Revenue Service would like to ensure that the impact of the strike on these transactions are minimised for both the taxpayer and SARS,” it said. “To this end, taxpayers are encouraged to submit their payments two business days in advance and similarly, conduct any tax transactions that may result in a payment to SARS, two business days in advance.” SARS added that taxpayers who require further assistance may contact the contact centre on 0800 00 7277. South Africa’s financial sector is expected to come to a standstill on Friday, with the country’s largest financial union Sasbo participating in a mass action. More than 40,000 members across the industry are expected to be involved in the strike action on the day, with protests planned in Johannesburg, Durban, Bloemfontein, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town.
