Volvo has launched On Call (VOC) in South Africa, an app-based service that helps motorists to communicate with their cars. Using the app via smartphone, smartwatch, tablet or desktop, motorists can remotely lock or unlock the doors to their car, check the fuel level from their office desk, and cool or heat their car before they get in. According to Greg Maruszewski, MD of Volvo Car South Africa, the app also comes with a number of associated safety and security benefits. “Motorists who forget to lock their car will get a notification message. And Volvo On Call automatically contacts the emergency services if you are involved in an accident and tells them where you are,” Maruszewski said. “Other remarkable capabilities of Volvo On Call include the ability to provide an in-car WiFi hotspot, which can be accessed by everyone in your car. “You can stream music and films to the car too.” Maruszewski said that the app will also assist you if have lost track of your car in a huge parking lot. “The app will show you the location of your car on a high-definition map, and then provide directions on how to reach it. “You can even ask your car to hoot and flash for five seconds to identify itself and guide you to its location,” he said. Volvo said VOC a standard feature in South Africa with effect from model year 2020 Volvo derivatives.  It is entirely free of charge for five years. Thereafter, it can be extended for a small fee. Drivers of vehicles other than Volvos can download the app for free and try it in demo mode. Read: Porsche unveils its first-ever electric car
