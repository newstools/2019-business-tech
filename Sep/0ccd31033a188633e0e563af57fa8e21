While hatches remain some of the most popular vehicles in South Africa, not all of them retain their value, warns Darryl Jacobson, managing director of True Price, who says that there are clear leaders when it comes to resale value. The True Price team attends hundreds of bank repossession auctions each year in order to gather data relating to prices paid on auction. This data is used to provide South African motorists with free vehicle evaluations. The data can also be used to provide highly accurate resale values. “Using the data gathered on bank repossession auctions, we are able to generate a statistically valid resale figure. It is expressed as a percentage of the original retail sales price,” said Jacobson. “Using this methodology, the Toyota Etios is the clear winner in the resale value stakes. It achieved 71.89%, placing it head and shoulders ahead of its competition,” he said. The Volkswagen Polo was ranked second (70.55%), followed by the Polo Vivo (69.79%). Below are the top six hatches by resale value according to True Price’s data.  The data relates to vehicles that have done a maximum of 140,000 km and were registered between 2016 – 2019 (both years inclusive).
