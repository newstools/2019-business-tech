Land Rover has provided the first details on its new Defender series which is set to launch in South Africa in 2020. The car will follow a phased roll-out with the larger Defender 110 expected to launch in the first half of the year, followed by the smaller Defender 90 later in the year. At launch, the 110 line-up will include a 3.0-litre straight six-cylinder P400 featuring efficient Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle technology with outputs of 294kW power and 550Nm of torque. Alternatively, customers can choose a 2.0-litre D240 turbodiesel with 177kW and 430Nm. The introduction of increased engine options, along with the short wheelbase 90 derivative, will follow later in 2020. All models feature permanent all-wheel drive and a twin-speed automatic gearbox, centre differential, and optional active locking rear differential.  Technology Land Rover’s ClearSight ground view technology helps drivers see the area usually hidden by the bonnet, directly ahead of the front wheels, on the central touchscreen. The Defender will also feature Jaguar Land Rover’s new Pivi Pro infotainment system. Configurable terrain response also debuts on new Defender, allowing experienced off-roaders to fine-tune individual vehicle settings to suit the conditions, while inexperienced drivers can let the system detect the most appropriate vehicle settings for the terrain, using the intelligent auto function. Additional details, including local pricing, are expected closer to launch.   Read: These are South Africa’s best-selling cars of 2019 so far
