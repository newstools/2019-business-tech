The city of Ekurhuleni, east of greater Johannesburg, says it will rename 42 streets and eight landmarks after political icons and other eminent individuals from the region. In a city council meeting on Wednesday (18 September), the municipality said that some of the recommended name changes include: The largest interchange in Africa – Gillooly’s interchange – will be renamed after anti-apartheid human rights lawyer advocate George Bizos; Olifantsfontein road will be renamed Winnie Madikizela Mandela road after the anti-apartheid icon and politician; The Van Buuren off-ramp will be renamed after former South African president Thabo Mbeki; Other street name changes include Mary Moodley (Snake Road), Lungile Mtshali (Edenvale Road), Magaret Gazo (Ego Road) and Sam Ntuli (Kliprivier Road). The Germiston government precinct will be renamed OR Tambo government precinct. “We must build a city whose landmarks, highways, streets and intersections bear a resemblance of all the people who make up its population,” said Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina. “The children of our city must grow up in an environment that bears names that are familiar to their home languages and of people they interface within their everyday lives. “I must emphasise that this is the beginning of a process of other phases to unfold in our programme to redress the apartheid legacy and promote social cohesion in our efforts in creating a National Democratic Society.” The city said it will be having further discussions with both national and provincial government as the process unfolds.
