Capitec plans to add over 600 new employees in the coming six months as it continues to expand its operations. Speaking at a presentation following the bank’s interim financial results on Thursday (26 September), Capitec CEO Gerrie Fourie said that the bank was hiring for a number of positions including service consultants, coders and data scientists. However, he noted that the bank has struggled to find skilled employees. “It has been very challenging,” he said. “If you give me 100 skilled data engineers, machine learning guys and IT professionals I would take them tomorrow.” “The shortage in that particular area is big and we need people in these areas, so no it’s not easy.” Fourie added that this demand for skilled employees is set to keep growing following Capitec’s acquisition of Mercantile Bank and its push towards a business banking offering. Growing Fourie said that in the coming months Capitec will also look to expand its branch footprint and use digital innovation and artificial intelligence to improve its offering and client insights. “We’re fortunate to be growing, continuously hiring new employees and not retrenching,” he said. “Our implementation of technology in the business has not posed a threat to jobs, instead it has helped us improve processes, freeing up our staff to help clients bank better.” Capitec has added 149 new hires since February 2019, bringing the total number of new employees to 13,923 people. “We have 834 branches across the country in convenient locations and approximately six million clients visit our branches every month. We have converted 122 branches where we have removed the cashier and implemented a full self-help functionality,” said Fourie. “This enabled us to add an additional consultant workstation for further capacity in the branch. “Altogether 21 new branches are scheduled to open during the second half of this financial year.” Read: 2 big changes for Capitec customers coming in the next month
