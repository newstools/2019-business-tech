Eskom says that a tornado which hit parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday (12 November) caused damage to its systems. At least two human casualties and 20 injuries have been reported as severe storms also battered the province. In a statement on Wednesday, the power utility said that 15 networks in the Mpolweni, Dalton, Wartburg, Albert Falls and Swayimani areas were affected, resulting in some 15,000 customers being affected. “Supply to about 5,000 customers was restored overnight and work is currently going on to restore power to the rest of the affected customers,” it said. “Some structures and lines are down, so restoration will take longer than usual as we will ensure that lines are safe to energise before we do so.”  While the tornado did not impact the national grid, Eskom said that its systems remains constrained and vulnerable, with generating plant performing at very low levels of reliability. With unplanned breakdowns at 9,500 MW as at 08h00, the probability of load shedding remains, but will only be implemented if absolutely necessary. There is sufficient diesel for our open cycle gas turbines and water at the pumped storage schemes to supplement the shortage of capacity if required, it said. “The Emergency Response Command Centre (ERCC) continues to monitor the system closely. “Eskom wishes to remind customers that any unexpected shift, such as additional unplanned breakdowns or the unavailability of diesel for open cycle gas turbines or low water levels at the pumped storage schemes, could result in load shedding at short notice.”  Read: Soweto residents should pay a R150 flat rate for electricity: report
