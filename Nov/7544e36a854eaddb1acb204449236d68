South Africa’s city centres are the biggest crime hot spots across the country, according to new data. Crimestatssa.com has broken down the latest SAPS crimes stats for 2019 regionally, to show which areas across South Africa’s nine provinces had the most reported crimes between April 2018 and March 2019. In South Africa, crimes need to be reported at the police station that is closest to where the crime took place, giving a fair indication of the crime levels in the general region the police station is found in. It should be noted, however, that station statistics may encompass more areas than just where the station is located. For example, a station in a remote area may represent the reported crimes of several neighbourhoods and small towns surrounding it, as it is the only station available to service those areas. There are approximately 1,140 police stations in the country.
