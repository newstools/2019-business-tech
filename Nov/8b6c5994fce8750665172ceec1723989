Car marketplace AutoTrader has launched its South African Car of the Year awards for 2020. A total of 48 vehicles from 21 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) qualify to be in the running to be named a semi-finalist. The vehicles were all launched in the period from 1 November 2018 up to and including 31 October 2019. “We made a number of meaningful changes to the competition last year – including the introduction of an online consumer vote and the inclusion of five categories,” said Rubin van Niekerk, chairman of the South African Guild of Motoring Journalists (SAGMJ). “This year, we are happy to introduce a further two categories,” he said. “The seven categories for 2020 are: Family, Leisure, Lifestyle, Premium Car, Premium SUV, Sport, and Urban.” The announcement of the semi-finalists takes place on 25 November 2019. Once the semi-finalists have been named, voting for finalists will take place. This will be followed by the test days in March 2020, when 27 of South Africa’s top motoring journalists will put the vehicles through their paces.
