Takealot has published a guide outlining when its 2019 Black Friday deals will go live. As in previous years, the group said that it will be hosting a Blue Dot sale running over the entire weekend.

Takealot’s Black Friday gross merchandise value (GMV) grew 125% from 2017 to 2018, with orders up 127%. Superbalist’s Black Friday GMV has grown on average around 50%. Reid said throughout the year they have been working to scale operations across multiple areas within the business. “After expanding our Johannesburg distribution centre (DC), our warehouse storage space now stands at 75,000m square. We house over 3.7 million items at any given time, and have opened 47 Takealot Pickup Points in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Limpopo, Free State and Mpumalanga for order collections and returns, with more to open in the coming months.” The Takealot group anticipates they’ll travel over 4 million km from Black Friday until 24 December. “To put that in context, it is the equivalent of circumnavigating the globe over 100 times” said Reid.
