Uber has launched its new RideCheck feature which will ‘check-in’ with riders and drivers if it detects any anomalies in a trip – such as an unexpectedly long stop or an unusual deviation. The ride-sharing company said that an overwhelming number of rides take place without incident, however its technology can still detect when something may not be going quite right. “When a RideCheck is initiated, both a rider and driver will receive a notification asking if everything is OK,” it said. “They can let us know through the app that all is well, or take other actions like using the in-app emergency button or simply sharing their ride with a trusted contact. This technology will continue to evolve, and we are working to add additional scenarios to RideCheck.” Uber said that a RideCheck can serve as ‘a gentle nudge reminder to both riders and drivers that it is are looking out for them’.  It will also help encourage users to report, it said. “This safety feature brings together many of the features we have developed over the last few years such as the safety centre, in-app emergency button, and trusted contacts,” said South African country manager Nduduzo Nyanda. “It is a great example of how tech can make travel safer than ever before, and will support our efforts to continue to prevent incidents and help set the standard for safety while traveling from A to B. While I’m proud of the progress we’ve made to enhance road safety, we know our work is never done.”” Uber said that the feature is now rolling out for all riders and drivers across South Africa.
