With all international and some regional flights back in operation, and domestic services carried out by sister airline Mango, South African Airways (SAA) says it is ‘on the road to operational recovery’. In a media briefing on Tuesday (19 November), acting chief executive officer Zuks Ramasia said a number of employees had returned to work despite the ongoing strike action. “We thank SAA employees who are back at work and those employees who have not joined the industrial action. They continue to carry our flag around the world. We also thank our loyal customers for supporting us in this difficult time.” “We applaud our committed employees for understanding that the airline cannot afford salary increases at present, because of the financial difficulties we are facing.” Ramasia said that the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA) and South African Airways Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) are demanding a wage increase of 8%, whilst the company will only be in a position to pay 5.9% in March 2020, assuming funds are available at that time. She further called on employees to return to work for the sake of our customers and the company. “After all, our customers contribute to our salaries and it is only through their confidence and custom that we can secure the future for SAA and ensure our essential contribution to the country’s economy. We are also very mindful of the contribution made by taxpayers to our sustainability,” she said. She added that all flights to the airline’s eight international destinations are now operating as usual and on an ongoing basis. SAA also resumed flights on Tuesday to six destinations on the African continent, namely Accra, Lagos, Lusaka, Maputo, Windhoek and Harare. Customers travelling to these destinations are being rebooked on the reinstated services and are being contacted accordingly, Ramasia said. Operational safety Following a number of reported safety concerns, Ramasia said that the airline’s operations are fully compliant with regulations in force. This has been further confirmed by the SA Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) that our operations are safe and fully compliant with international safety standards, she said. “Safety is our primary responsibility. SAA has never – and will never – compromise safety under any circumstances. “The statements made by SACCA and NUMSA are deeply regrettable, untruthful and without foundation. In response, SAA is taking appropriate legal action for these statements to be retracted. “Our flight deck, cabin crew and technicians are highly qualified. For example, on the international flights operated by SAA on Sunday, each member of our cabin crew team had an average of 16 years’ experience, and each pilot on the flight deck had an average of 20 years’ experience.” Status of the strike Ramasia said that a growing number of our employees do not support the strike. She said that employees are coming back to work, and this is evidenced by the increasing number of flights in operation. “Participating in industrial action is a personal choice. Unfortunately, there have been several incidents relating to intimidation against staff, as well as attempted non-compliance of picketing rules. “No one should ever be pressured by any union official or member to participate in this industrial action. The airline will not tolerate any form of intimidation against those wishing to report for duty, and is taking the necessary measures to protect them in the workplace.” She said that the strike also comes at a personal cost to employees. “With SAA’s ‘no-work-no-pay’ principle, the salary loss for a striking employee embarking on strike action for seven days will take him or her approximately four months to recover. This is calculated on the basis of a 5.9% salary increase, implemented against the total cost of employment. “The conciliation process with the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) will be reconvened shortly to mediate in the current deadlock between unions and management is ongoing. “Our efforts are focused on finding solutions that recognise employees’ concerns, safeguard the business and return operations to normal without delay.” Read: SAA says planes are safe
