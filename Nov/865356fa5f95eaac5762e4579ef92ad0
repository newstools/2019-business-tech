When looking at active job seekers across various sectors (indicated by the Supply graph), areas of high supply correlate closely to areas of high demand, however supply outstrips demand in some areas, leading to a competitive environment for job seekers. The opposite is seen in some industries. “The medical & health, marketing and business & management sectors experienced a growing demand trend over the last quarter. Hiring activity increased by more than 5% for professionals in these sectors. “Year-on-year, demand decreased for professionals in the architecture & engineering and building & construction sector as well as in the manufacturing & assembly sector.” Read: New case deals with employees who strike with weapons in South Africa
