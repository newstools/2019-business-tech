A new luxury hotel built out of container ships has launched in the UK, called the Stow Away. Stow Away is a new sustainable and eco friendly ‘apart hotel’ concept, with the first base in Waterloo, London, built from 26 re-purposed shipping containers. The concept was designed and realised by design studio Doone Silver Kerr, built through a joint venture between Stow Projects and Ciel Capital and managed by hospitality group, BridgeStreet. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354183" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stow-Away-Hotel.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="960" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stow-Away-Hotel.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stow-Away-Hotel-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />
