With Black Friday 2019 set to fall on 29 November, South African retailers have begun sharing their plans for the big shopping day. While Black Friday is an American tradition, local retailers have adopted in large numbers. Black Friday is particularly popular among e-commerce players and is now the biggest online shopping day in South Africa. Speaking to Jacaranda, Takealot said its first deals will be available from 00h01 on the day with a number of products on sale across a range of categories. It added that these deals will continue into the weekend with special ‘weekend deals’ and will continue into Cyber Monday. The online store said its sale will culminate on ‘Takealot Tuesday’ on 3 December. In 2018 Takealot said its annual Blue Dot Sale generated record sales on Black Friday, with R11.5 million in sales within the first hour. The total transaction value for Black Friday 2018 on Takealot amounted to over R196 million – a 125% year-on-year growth in sales and 127% growth in orders. 68% of shoppers buying Black Friday deals on Takealot placed orders on their mobile phones via the Takealot app and mobile site. Takealot CEO Kim Reid said electronics proved to be a firm favourite, with over three thousand TVs sold on the day. Best-selling items included perfume, camping gear such as folding tables, portable hard drives, and the DStv Explora decoder.
