Electric scooter and bike rentals company Lime will launch its service in Cape Town in early 2020. The initial fleet of scooters will be available at ‘strategic, privately-owned locations throughout the city’, the group said in a statement on Tuesday (26 November). “Cape Town is helping lead the way forward on technology and innovation in Africa, and we’re excited to be a part of that story,” said Wayne Ting, global head of operations and strategy at Lime. “Our mission is to improve urban living through sustainable, affordable transportation, and we’re looking forward to extending meaningful mobility access and reduced carbon emissions to South Africans living in and travelling to Cape Town.” With the addition of Cape Town to its global ridership community, Ting said that Lime will now offer micro-mobility services on six continents worldwide.  <img class="size-full wp-image-357489 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lime-3.png" alt="" width="363" height="731" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lime-3.png 363w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lime-3-149x300.png 149w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 85vw, 363px" /> Lime currently works through a mobile app – similar to Uber – where users are able to hire dock-free rental bikes, e-assist bikes, and electric scooters. Users scan a barcode on the scooter to activate it and are able to make payments directly through their app. The vehicles also have built-in trackers meaning it is easy to see where the closest vehicle is. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-357511" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Lime-4-e1574837928622.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1534" /> Read: Cape Town looks at regulating Uber and food delivery services as traffic grows
