Eskom says it will implement stage 2 load shedding between 10 pm on Thursday evening, until 5 am on Friday. “Today we lost three additional generation units and had to use our emergency reserves in order to meet the demand throughout the day,” the power utility said in a statement on social media. The group said it had been working hard to avoid load shedding and asked consumers to continue using electricity sparingly. Eskom warned on Wednesday that its grid is severely constrained and that it is using emergency resources to keep the lights on. The risk of load shedding remains, it said at the time. Eskom said that it has experienced unplanned breakdowns on its network above 12,000MW, with the group’s ‘load-shedding free’ plan targeting no breakdowns above 9,500MW. Any move over 9,500MW requires the use of emergency power resources, it said, which involves using diesel and pumped water storage generation at high rates. Bloomberg recently reported that while the impact of the latest round of load shedding is yet to be clearly outlined, estimates predict that the previous cost of the blackouts on the economy range from between R1 billion – R5 billion a day.
