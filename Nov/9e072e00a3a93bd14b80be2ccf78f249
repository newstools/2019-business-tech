Bidorbuy has outlined its plans for Black Friday 2019. The online retailer said that this year its deals will run for a week, with discounts of up to 70% on a number of items including: Laptops;
Smartphones;
Speaker systems;
Home appliances;
Watches. “Black Friday has become a global shopping event. We’re working hard to exceed the rising expectations of South Africa’s online shoppers,” said Bidorbuy CEO Craig Lubbe. “We are preparing an entire week of great Black Friday deals on a wide range of heavily discounted products,” he said. To make the most of Black Friday discounts, Lubbe advises shoppers to prepare a list and set a budget. “It is a good idea to start with big-ticket items such as smart TVs, sound systems, or appliances,” he said. “These items typically have limited stock and bigger rand-value discounts than smaller products, so you’ll have more to regret if you miss out on them.” Lubbe said that customers can also register early with Bidorbuy, to avoid losing time while other shoppers are snapping up the best deals. He said that the 2019 Bidorbuy Black Friday week opens on 25 November and lasts until 1 December. The first of these deals will launch at midnight on 25 November to get a head start on everyone else. “All our deals are available through the site, on desktop or mobile, and on our shopping apps for iOS and Android.” The group will also launch ‘Cyber Monday’ deals during the following week running from 2 to 8 December.
