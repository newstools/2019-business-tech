The City of Cape Town has approved a new municipal planning by-law in which will it make it easier for homeowners to rent out their properties as Airbnbs.. The proposal allows for short-term letting from a house or flat for a period not exceeding 30 consecutive days for the same guest/traveller. The by-law amendment has now been assented to and will soon be promulgated in the provincial gazette. Airbnb said it welcomes the decision by the city to amend the by-law. “Airbnb believes the proposed rules are right for Cape Town and show the city’s progressive attitude,” said Velma Corcoran, Airbnb country manager for Sub-Saharan Africa. “Positive results can be achieved when policymakers and Airbnb work together on the shared goals of making cities better places to live, work and visit. “Airbnb has worked with many governments around the world, and would like to congratulate Cape Town on supporting entrepreneurship and empowerment.” Corcoran said that recently released data by Airbnb shows that: More than 2 million guests have stayed in homes listed on Airbnb in South Africa since 2008;
In 2018, the estimated direct economic impact of Airbnb in the country was more than R8.7 billion;
Airbnb has supported the equivalent of 22,000 jobs across South Africa. Corcoran said the amended by-law announcement highlights Cape Town’s support of the home-sharing community. “It ensures that together, Airbnb and the City of Cape Town can help spread the benefits of tourism to those who haven’t previously been able to be part of the tourism economy, thereby helping more locals, their immediate communities and the city to reap the economic gains that tourism brings,” she said.
