South Africa’s biggest sales day has arrived, and even the country’s fast-food chains are getting in on the Black Friday deals. Pizza Hut, Domino’s Pizza and Starbucks are running some one-day-only specials on food and drinks – with Debonairs, Mochachos, Burger King, King Pie and KFC also coming to the party with lower prices on local favourites. Keep in mind that many fast-food restaurants are owned by franchisees which can offer their own exclusive deals, so be sure to check with your local branch – you never know when you could find a really great special. Here’s what’s on offer: Starbucks <img class="aligncenter wp-image-358331" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks-Black-Friday.jpg" alt="" width="744" height="744" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks-Black-Friday.jpg 960w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks-Black-Friday-300x300.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks-Black-Friday-150x150.jpg 150w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks-Black-Friday-768x768.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks-Black-Friday-50x50.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Starbucks has a buy-one-get-one0free special on all its frappuccinos today – while it is also offering up to 50% off its merchandise.
