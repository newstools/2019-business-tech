Product rating website AirlineRatings.com has announced Air New Zealand as its Airline of the Year for 2020. Air New Zealand is being honoured for the sixth time for its record-breaking performance, multi award winning in-flight innovations, operational safety, environmental leadership and motivation of its staff. These factors have stamped the airline as a clear industry leader. The AirlineRatings.com Airline Excellence Awards, judged by seven editors with over 200 years’ industry experience, combine major safety and government audits, with 12 key criteria that include: fleet age, passenger reviews, profitability, investment rating, product offerings, and staff relations. www.AirlineRatings.com editor-in-chief Geoffrey Thomas said: “In our analysis Air New Zealand came out number one in most of our audit criteria, which is an outstanding performance when it is up against carriers with more resources and scale. “Air New Zealand’s commitment to excellence in all facets of its business starts at the top with outstanding governance and one of the best executive teams in aviation through to a workforce that is delivering consistently to the airline’s strategy and customer promise,” Thomas says. Air New Zealand also won Best Premium Economy, while Singapore Airlines won Best First Class and Qatar Airways Best Catering and Best Business Class. The six suites in this stylish cabin at the front of the upper deck of Singapore Airline’s flagship Airbus A380s are designed to be the equivalent of small hotel rooms. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356929" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite.jpg 1280w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356931" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite1.jpg" alt="" width="797" height="448" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite1.jpg 797w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Singapore-Airlines-Suite1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Qantas, won Best Domestic Airline Service and Best Lounges.
