Shoprite and Checkers have outlined their plans for Black Friday 2019. The retailers said that they will be offering a range of deals and customers will be able to stock up for the fast-approaching holiday period with massive discounts on various grocery and household essentials. “Extensive planning commences at least 6 months in advance to ensure we give customers the very best Black Friday experience,” said Willie Peters, GM of marketing at Shoprite and Checkers. “As with previous years, we will again stay true to what Black Friday is all about – deep-cut specials that offer real value. We have been hard at work to secure the best deals and to ensure all our stores are sufficiently stocked,” he said. Peters added that there are currently over 1,000 Shoprite, Checkers and Checkers Hyper stores across South Africa, and that the retail giant will be sufficiently staffed and offer extended Black Friday trading hours to ensure a satisfying shopping experience for its customers. He said that Shoprite, Checkers and Checkers Hyper stores served 125 customers per second on Black Friday in 2018. Some of the deals offered in 2018 included a 50% saving on OMO washing powder and 40% off items such as Jacobs instant coffee, Weetbix and Ultramel custard. New rewards programme This year members of the newly launched Xtra Savings rewards programme will be the first to receive advance notifications of the Black Friday deals on offer at Checkers, the retailer said. A total of two million customers have signed up for Xtra Savings in just 20 days following the launch of the rewards programme in mid-October. Shoppers still have time to join Xtra Savings ahead of this year’s Black Friday and can do so free of charge, and in less than three minutes, using a number of paperless channels. Xtra Savings members also stand a chance to win their Black Friday shopping for free, it said. Read: How shops will try ‘trick’ South Africans on Black Friday 2019, according to Capitec
