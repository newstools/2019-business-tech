Power utility Eskom has warned that its grid is severely constrained and that it is currently using emergency resources to keep the lights on. The risk of load shedding remains, it said. Eskom said that it has experienced unplanned breakdowns on its network above 12,000MW, with the group’s ‘load-shedding free’ plan targeting no breakdowns above 9,500MW. Any move over 9,500MW requires the use of emergency power resources, it said, which involves using diesel and pumped water storage generation at high rates. “There is an increased probability of load shedding if the supply constraints are sustained for a long duration,” Eskom said. Notably, the power utility said that the extended use of diesel and pumped water storage this week has also led to a decline in the level of reserves available. “Concerted effort is being made to replenish these reserves,” it said. The group said it will provide updates as the day continues, but said consumers should check their load shedding schedules with their respective municipalities.
