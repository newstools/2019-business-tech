What started as a post-Thanksgiving blowout sale by US retailers has snowballed into one of the most significant calendar days for consumers and retailers in South Africa. Black Friday – which falls on 29 November 2019 – is typically characterised by cheap deals and frenzied shoppers trying to snag them. “Black Friday may have started as a day where businesses pushed older stock for clearance purposes, but it has morphed into a stand-alone sale day driven by the fact that people know for certain that the very best deals are available,” says Matthew Leighton, spokesperson of online retailer, OneDayOnly.co.za. He added that online shopping in South Africa has grown tremendously over the years, with OneDayOnly recording over 150,000 new website users on Black Friday alone in 2018. Speaking to BusinessTech, Leighton said that OneDayOnly plans to build on its successes of last year and use insights to ‘tighten up’ the areas were it feels it was not up to standard. “Delivery is always the one area where we can really impress or really frustrate our customers,” he said. “Because of the reliance on external courier companies for the last mile, this is never 100% in our hands, but we intend to make every effort to ensure the shortcomings faced previously are improved and areas of strength are further reinforced.” Leighton said that OneDayOnly’s sale will take place over a number of days and extend into Cyber Monday deals in December. “As well as the Friday itself, we will be running huge sales days in the week leading up to the Friday, and we have big plans for the following Monday (Cyber Monday) after Black Friday too.” “Anything and everything (will be on sale). Because the nature of OneDayOnly.co.za is to offer something for everyone, we fully intend to have a range of specials on Black Friday to cater to as many people as possible.” Read: A list of stores offering Black Friday 2019 deals in South Africa
