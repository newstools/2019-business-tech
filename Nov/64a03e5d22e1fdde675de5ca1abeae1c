Vodacom Business is extending its pan-African network to Miami in the United States through the new undersea South Atlantic Cable System (SACS). The cable is the first undersea cable to directly link the African continent’s southern hemisphere with South America. “This new trans-Atlantic route offers a significantly cost effective and faster way for African-based American multi-national corporations to connect back to the United States, reducing latency by up to 40%,” Vodacom said. Guy Clarke, managing director for Vodacom Business International said that the group is undertaking the investment to shorten the distance between the American and African continents. “The reduction in latency which this route provides will allow various business applications and services to function optimally across continents. Vodacom Business has signed its first client – a global oil and gas multinational corporation – to use the service.” Vodacom’s Miami point-of-presence (POP) also connects directly back to its European network. This triangulated network topology will bring the United States, Europe and Africa closer together. The trans-Atlantic expansion follows the recent addition of 19 countries to Vodacom Business’ Africa market footprint, which increased the company’s overall coverage to 47 countries across Africa.
