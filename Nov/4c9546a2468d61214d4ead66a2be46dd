Eskom says that its systems remain tight and vulnerable, with the power utility warning of a high risk of load shedding on Friday (8 November). Eskom instituted stage 2 load shedding between 10h00 on Thursday evening and 05h00 on Friday due to the failure of generating units. “We lost three additional generation units and had to use our emergency reserves in order to meet the demand throughout the day,” it said. “While the system remains extremely constrained and vulnerable, the overnight load shedding assisted with partial recovery of our emergency resources to enable us to get through the morning. “We will need to continue to replenish both our water levels at pimped storage schemes and diesel four our open-cycle gas turbines over the weekend in order to place us is a better position to stabilise for the weekend ahead.” Eskom said its objective is to avoid load shedding, however, the given the above breakdowns it warned that the chance of load shedding remained high in the afternoon. “Eskom’s technical teams are working tirelessly to return units from planned and unplanned maintenance and to replenish emergency reserves,” it said.
