The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says it will not back the ANC’s plans to continue with the controversial e-tolls system. In a statement on Wednesday (13 November), the group likened the proposed ‘user pays’ system to the pay-as-you-go system used by cellular companies, adding that the ANC led government is not a private company and it is duty-bound to provide services to the people, including quality roads. “Minister Mbalula promised us a process that will come out with a solution and it is astounding that Luthuli House is already telling us the outcomes of the process that is yet to start. “This is a sign of arrogance and it also shows that some of the people entrusted with leadership positions are out of touch with reality,” it said. “Cosatu Gauteng reiterates its long-standing position that building of roads is the responsibility of government and the people of Gauteng contributes through tax and fuel levy for this to be possible.” The trade federation added that the ruling party stands to lose more votes if it continues with the unpopular toll scheme. “The ANC should also appreciate that the people of Gauteng voted them in power on the 8th of May 2019 with the understanding that e-tolls will be scrapped. “The latest statement is a slap in the face for all those who were promised that the solution will be found that does not include punishing motorists in this province. “This political zig-zagging and policy flip-flopping are the reasons the ANC has lost 12% of the electoral support over the last decade in the province.” Cosatu said it will mobilise its Gauteng members, non-governmental organisations and business sympathetic to its call to scrap the e-tolls by closing all the toll roads in Gauteng. “We further call all motorists in Gauteng to continue to boycott paying e-toll accounts including the 30% that is currently paying,” it said.
