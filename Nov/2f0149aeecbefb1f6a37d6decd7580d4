A number of local retailers have announced that they will hold early sales ahead of Black Friday, which falls on 29 November. With the shopping day falling later than usual this year, FNB says that more stores are likely to spread their deals out over a number of days to capitalise on the phenomenon and to ensure that their systems can handle the higher than usual load. A recent report by PwC found that consumers plan to spend 36% more this year versus 2018, with local shoppers planning to spend an average of R3,812 during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2019. It added that some 85% of South Africans surveyed confirmed that they intend to buy something or will consider it if there is a good enough deal. The most popular product categories during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2019 will be durables like electrical equipment, technology goods, homewares, clothing, shoes and accessories, it said. The most notable early Black Friday deals are below.
