Game has released a brochure containing some of its top deals for Black Friday 2019. With Black Friday set to fall on 29 November, Game said that 95 of stores will be open at midnight while an additional 27 stores will be open at 06h00. It added that a number of deals will be available through its online store. “We have worked to secure unbeatable deals with our suppliers for Black Friday. The range of products we have on special during Black Friday ranges from TVs, computers, appliances, cellular, baby products, DIY tools and much more,” it said. “During Black Friday, we are committed to having all deliveries fulfilled within 7-10 working days. “You will pay R90 per delivery if you ordered online only and there will be a R70 delivery fee per additional large appliance.” It added that it has a number of plans in place to make sure their online store stays up during the Black Friday rush. “Game IT teams are working hard to ensure this doesn’t happen, including introducing more capacity to handle twice the number of online users as 2018. “We are working closely with PayU (a payment gateway for online purchases), SABC and all the South African banks, to ensure that we provide our customers with a seamless transaction and checkout experience.” You can find the brochure below.
