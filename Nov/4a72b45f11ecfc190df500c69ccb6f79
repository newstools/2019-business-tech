The Department of Energy has published the official petrol price changes for November 2019, with decreases across the board. The price of petrol 93 and 95 will drop by 13 cents per litre, while diesel will drop by 14 and 16 cents per litre for 0.005% and 0.05% Sulphur content, respectively. Illuminating paraffin will see its per litre price drop by 23 cents (wholesale), and LPGAS will drop by 30 cents per kilogram. Petrol 93 – decrease by 13 cents per litre
Petrol 95 – decrease by 13 cents per litre
Diesel 0.05% – decrease by 16 cents per litre
Diesel 0.005% – decrease by 14 cents per litre
Illuminating paraffin – decrease by 23 cents per litre The price cuts come as international petroleum prices decreased over the period under review, the department said. The cuts would have been slightly larger, had the rand performed better against the US dollar over the same period, however. The rand depreciated against the US dollar during the period under review, on average, when compared to the previous period. The average rand/US dollar exchange rate for the period 27 September 2019 to 31 October 2019 was 14.9293 compared to 14.8432 during the previous period. This led to a higher contribution to the Basic Fuel Prices on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 4.08 c/l, 4.33 c/l and 4.34 c/l, respectively. The changes will take effect from Wednesday, 6 November. Here is how the prices will change: Read: South Africans turn to eBucks and other reward programmes to offset rising petrol prices
