Aston Martin, the British independent manufacturer of luxury sports cars, has unveiled its first motorcycle – the AMB 001 developed in conjunction with bike brand Brough Superior. The track-only AMB 001 boasts exclusive technical features, including a chassis configuration with a double-wishbone front fork and structural carbon fibre body. Aston Martin said that all of the components have been specially designed using the best processes and materials, including carbon fibre, titanium and billet aluminium. The AMB 001 is being built and hand-assembled in the Brough Superior factory in Toulouse, and will be strictly limited to 100 models, which may explain its 108,000 euros (R1,769,817) price tag. With first deliveries expected in the fourth quarter of 2020, here is what owners can expect: Engine – The AMB 001 boasts a DOHC 997 cc 8-valve 88-degree V-twin engine that is both water and oil-cooled. The transmission includes an extractible 6-speed gearbox an APTC Clutch, and final drive by chain. Timing is driven by a short morse chain and a gear train. Turbo – The AMB 001 boasts a turbo-charged output of 134 kW (180 hp) at just 180 kilos dry weight. The exhaust manifold is made from Inconel, a superalloy chosen for its thermal and mechanical properties. Body – The body parts are fully made from carbon fibre, even when non-visible. The leather seat is handcrafted equally as a luxury car interior, with high-quality leather and stitching, matching with the handcrafted handlebars grips, the group said. Chassis –  The wheels are machined from aluminium forgings and have an exclusive AMB 001 design. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-351707 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_2-jpg-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="525" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_2-jpg-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_2-jpg-300x188.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_2-jpg-768x480.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_2-jpg-1200x750.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-351709 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_3-jpg-1-1024x630.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="517" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_3-jpg-1-1024x630.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_3-jpg-1-300x184.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_3-jpg-1-768x472.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_3-jpg-1-1200x738.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-351713 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_4-jpg-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_4-jpg-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_4-jpg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_4-jpg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_4-jpg-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-351715 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_7-jpg-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_7-jpg-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_7-jpg-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_7-jpg-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/The_AMB_001_by_Aston_Martin_and_Brough_Superior_7-jpg-1-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read:  Top 10 most searched-for budget city cars under R140,000
