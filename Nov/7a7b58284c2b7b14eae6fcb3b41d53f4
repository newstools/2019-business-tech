Coffee giant Starbucks has unveiled the world’s largest Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Chicago, featuring exclusive coffees, a cocktail bar and a kitchen operated by local Italian bakery Princi serving desserts, pizza and salads. The epic 35,000-square-foot Reserve Roastery will include locally inspired craft cocktails, barrel aged coffee and collaborations with local artists and vendors and will reportedly employ about 200 people including roasters, baristas, commessas, bakers, and mixologists. Starbucks Reserve Roastery Chicago is the company’s sixth Reserve Roastery, joining locations in Seattle, Shanghai, Milan, New York and Tokyo. “Visitors will be able to see, hear and learn about coffee’s extraordinary journey through intentional and unparalleled design, while enjoying a menu featuring unique beverages exclusive to this location,” Starbucks said. “The design of the Chicago Roastery was inspired by the iconic Chicago landmark, and the city itself,” said Jill Enomoto, vice president of Roastery Design & Concept for Starbucks. “We embraced the building’s natural light, married it with shades of classic Starbucks greens and intentionally wove in design features to encourage customer exploration and highlight the love and respect we have for coffee.” The Starbucks Reserve Roastery Chicago is a working coffee roastery where Starbucks Roasters will be small-batch roasting Starbucks rarest single-origin coffees and blends called Starbucks Reserve. The coffee roasted in Chicago will be served exclusively to visitors of the location, available in handcrafted beverages as well as freshly scooped whole bean coffee. Coffee Bars There are three main coffee bars at the Roastery, which in total offer seven brewing methods, including espresso, pour over, coffee press, siphon, Chemex, Clover and cold brewing. The Chicago Roastery will also feature a dedicated Arriviamo Bar, like the Starbucks Reserve Roastery locations in New York and Milan. “Inspired by the Italian tradition of aperitivo, the Arriviamo Bar will be a destination for customers looking for a carefully crafted cocktail,” the coffee maker said. In addition to coffee beverages, Roastery visitors can enjoy food at Princi, an artisanal boutique bakery and cafe founded by Italian baker Rocco Princi. “As the exclusive food purveyor at Starbucks Reserve locations, Princi offers on-site baking of fresh breads, cornetti and focaccia, pizza and salads, plus cakes and tarts,” Starbucks said. Exclusive to the Chicago Roastery will be a bakery conveyor that has been designed by Starbucks to transport fresh baked goods from the Princi bakery on the second floor, to the Starbucks Reserve Coffee Bar on the main level. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354327" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks1.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354329" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks2.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354335" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks8-e1573798214483.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354367" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Starbucks12-e1573800413387.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354353" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="498" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery1.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery1-300x146.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery1-768x374.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354355" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery2.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354357" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery3.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-354359" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/StarbucksRoastery4-e1573800165486.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> Read: The future of Starbucks in South Africa
