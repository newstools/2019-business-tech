Pick n Pay launched its weekly Black November deals for its Gauteng and Western Cape online shoppers last Monday (4 November), with the retailer reporting a record number of visitors to its website. The ‘Black November’ deals go live on Pick n Pay’s online shop every Monday at 07h00 and will be valid for seven days or until stocks last, the retailer said. It said that the deals will offer up to 50% off across various categories including groceries, appliances, electronics, wine and liquor, household items and baby essentials. The group said that the demand for cleaning and household products appear to be the most popular purchase so far. “Items to restock pantries were some of the most searched and bought deals,” says John Bradshaw, retail executive for marketing at Pick n Pay. “The online store also reported a record number of orders when compared to last year. “Our systems were able to keep up with the demand and our teams effectively managed and dispatched all orders to happy customers.” Delivery Bradshaw said that Pick n Pay’s online delivery capacity has also been ramped up to avoid any delays in customers getting their items. In addition to offering free delivery to some customers, Bradshaw said that the retailer has also launched ‘Black November saver delivery’ slots from this week. This is a discounted rate for customers who don’t mind what time of the day their order is delivered, he said, “Should customers want their delivery to take place in the morning or afternoon, customers can still select the normal delivery option which allows them to select a delivery slot. “For either delivery option though, customers are notified what time to expect their delivery on their selected date and can track their order.” Read: A list of stores offering Black Friday 2019 deals in South Africa
