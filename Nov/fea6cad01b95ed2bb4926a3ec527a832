Pick n Pay has released a brochure containing some of its top deals for Black Friday 2019. Pick n Pay has been preparing for Black Friday 2019 for several months, with the retailer expecting customers to use the shopping holiday for most of their year-end purchases. John Bradshaw, retail executive of marketing at Pick n Pay, says that pantry items were most popular last Black Friday, closely followed by televisions and beer “Many customers used Black Friday deals as an opportunity to refill their pantries, especially ahead of the Christmas period,” he said. “Popular items included long-life milk, sugar, coffee, rice washing power and toilet paper.” Bradshaw said that Pick n Pay customers typically have two priorities on Black Friday: they want to stock up on basic food items, but they also want to spoil themselves. “We believe we’ve secured great deals this year to deliver just that for Black Friday. Our supermarkets will have deals on everyday items while our Hypermarkets will also offer great deals on a range of appliances and electronics,” he said. “We’ve been working with our suppliers for months now to ensure all stores and online have the right stock available, at the right prices, in the right quantities.” You can find Pick n Pay’s Black Friday brochure below (deals valid from 27 November to 1 December).
