The majority of developers in South Africa list JavaScript as one of their primary languages, ahead of C#. However, Python is rapidly rising up the charts, and is in second place on developers’ ‘want-to-learn’ list, after being the fifth most used language in 2019. That’s according to technology talent marketplace OfferZen’s State of the Software Developer Nation survey, which polled over 4,000 developers to find out about skills, work experience and opportunities among the South African developer community. Of the most popular languages developers chose, Go and Ruby are among the languages that pay the most across all levels of experience, the report said. Developers who know Python earn the third highest salary at junior and intermediate level. However, at senior level, developers who know Java earn about R1,500 more than those who know TypeScript or Python. PHP developers earn the lowest salaries, no matter how much experience they have.
