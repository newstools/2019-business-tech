Data from July 2019, shows that Steers has the second-largest presence (+-600 stores), followed by Debonairs in third (+-569 stores). According to the Franchising Association of South Africa, at the end of 2018, the estimated turnover for the entire franchising sector totalled R721 billion for the year – equivalent to 15.7% of the total South African GDP (up from 3.3% the year before). A survey among franchisors found that one in three made a turnover of R20 million or more, and most expressed optimism that their business future remains positive. However, the segment is not without its challenges, particularly from wider economic issues like slow growth and lack of skilled workers – while consumer spending is also under pressure.
