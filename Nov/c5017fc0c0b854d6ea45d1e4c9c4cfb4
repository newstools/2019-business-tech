Over the last 10 years, Otto Wireless Solutions has become synonymous within the industrial connectivity circles for delivering high quality, affordable products, and their brand of outdoor LTE antennas, aptly named Ottennas, have quietly become the go-to high performance antennas for many industrial clients. Over the course of 2019 the company, under the leadership of industry veterans Barry Culligan and Chris Viveiros, ventured into the commercial space via their distribution partnership with TP-Link, and have proven they have what it takes to make waves within the commercial space too.

Chris Viveiros, one of the founding members and Operations Director, had this to say, “As more families add more connected devices, the demand for bandwidth is going to continue to rise, and a standalone commercial LTE router, although a great starting point, quickly reaches the edge of its performance.” “Adding an outdoor antenna to a router which can accommodate one is the next step. We are fortunate to be one of the few companies in the position where we can offer customers incredible value for money, when we put one of our Ottennas alongside a great commercial router brand like TP-Link.” “Whether you are streaming, gaming, or just need the Internet for social media and basic connectivity, we have found that the stability and reliability of the TP-Link products, along with the attractive price tag, has made the combination of the Ottennas and TP-Link router a perfect match.” This approach has been a major contributing factor towards Otto Wireless’ meteoric rise as a major TP-Link distributor throughout 2019. <img class="size-full wp-image-356995 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ottena.png" alt="Ottena" width="640" height="431" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ottena.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Ottena-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> For Black Friday, Otto Wireless Solutions will be marketing limited stocks of their 2 most popular Ottennas, as well as router packages, and will be extending their specials over the entire week, commencing on Monday 25 November, and ending on Friday 29 November.
