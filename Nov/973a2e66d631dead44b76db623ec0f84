Acting SAA chair Thandeka Mgoduso has warned that the airline is at a tipping point and may close its doors if the strike action against it continues, the Sunday Times reports. Mgoduso said that the airline is currently surviving on the goodwill of its lenders and could struggle to pay salaries at the end of the month due to a lack of income caused by the strike. She added that it was pointless to apply for business rescue as ‘there would be nothing left to rescue’. “If this strike perpetuates and there is no money coming into the company, everyone that we owe will want their money and where does the money come from? “There is nothing to rescue and that is why we are doing what we are doing to ensure that we return the company to a state where it can be turned around. “The employees that are on strike are the ones that are going to cause SAA to close,” she said. Flight delays On Friday SAA said it has extended the cancellation of all domestic and regional flights scheduled for Sunday (17 November) and Monday (18 November). The airline says this is an operational decision aimed at minimising the impact of disruptions on the airline’s customers. It added that it plans to reintroduce international flights. SAA said it has also worked with its sister airline, Mango Airlines, to re-accommodate as many customers as possible travelling on domestic services. This may mean changes in timing and aircraft types, but aims to ensure that SAA’s customers reach their intended destination with minimal disruption, it said.
