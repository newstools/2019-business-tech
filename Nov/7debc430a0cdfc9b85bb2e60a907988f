Ahead of its big Black Friday 2019 sale on 29 November, Game has released a list of stores which will be opening at midnight on the day. Speaking to BusinessTech, Massmart said that its research shows that a significant amount of customers preferred stores to open for longer during this trading period. “As such we will once again have extended trading hours at selected stores. For instance, 93 out of 122 Game stores in SA, and 13 out of the 28 on the rest of the continent will be trading at midnight. “We will also have 29 Game stores trading from 06h00. As with previous years we will have a standard delivery fee regardless of radius to our stores.” You can find the full list of Game stores that will be open from 00h00 – 19h00 on Black Friday.
