Eskom introduced stage 2 load shedding from 09h00 to 23h00 on Wednesday (16 October) due to a shortage of capacity. In a statement, the power company said that the severe supply constraint was due to high levels of unplanned breakdowns. “The supply constraint is caused by, among others, five generating units that are unavailable due to boiler tube leaks,” it said. “In addition, a conveyor belt supplying Medupi power station with coal failed on Saturday (12 October) resulting in low volumes of coal being supplied to the power station thus limiting the generating capacity to approximately half the station output.” Eskom said that due to the shortage of generating capacity from coal-fired generation, its the pumped storage and Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) generators have also been used extensively since Saturday, which has led to a decline in dam levels and diesel tank levels. “We unreservedly apologise to South Africans for the negative impact this may have on them and want to assure the nation that we continue to work tirelessly to ensure the security of energy supply,” it said. To help reduce the load on its systems, Eskom said that users can: Set air-conditioners to an average of 23 degrees celsius;
Switch off your geysers over peak periods;
Use the cold water tap rather than using the geyser every time;
Set your swimming pool pump cycle to run twice a day, three hours at a time for optimal use;
At the end of the day, turn off computers, copiers, printers and fax machines at the switch. Avoid stand-by or sleep mode. Read: Eskom is load shedding again
