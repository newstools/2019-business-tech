The City of Johannesburg is working to restore its systems after a damaging cyber attack, it said in a statement on Monday (28 October). The city said the attack, which took place on Thursday (24 October), breached its network and resulted in unauthorised access to its systems. “The individuals responsible have demanded that we pay four bitcoins valued at approximately R500,000 by today. “I can confirm that the city will not concede to their demands and we are confident that we will be able to restore the systems to full functionality”. Councillor Funzela Ngobeni said that the city has made significant progress in bringing systems online and that it should be able to restore 80% of all its systems. He added that the city has been able to restore its critical customer-facing systems including billing, the property valuation system, eHealth and library services. “In the meantime customers are advised to pay their average consumption. As systems come up, we will be phasing-in active customer services.” Ngobeni added that the city was working with a number of international ICT professionals and state security bodies to analyse the attack and prevent future incidents.
