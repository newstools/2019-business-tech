The UK government has announced a new immigration route for overseas students in the UK. According to immigration consultants Breytenabchs, the new route will enable overseas students in the UK to stay for two years after they graduate. “The UK government hopes that these plans will enable some of the best students to stay,” Breytenbachs said. “They also hope to attract more talent to the UK. This will, of course, offer wonderful opportunities for graduating overseas students.” However, Breytenbachs noted that the new plans will only be officially introduced sometime in 2020. Who qualifies? To qualify for the new route, the graduate must have studied at a so-called trusted UK university or higher education provider. A ‘trusted’ provider includes any institution which has a proven track record at the UK’s Home Office. “The good news is also that there will be no cap on the number of overseas students that will qualify under these new plans,” Breytenbachs said. “Overseas graduates in any subject will be able to stay in the UK for two years to find work. “They will be allowed to apply for jobs regardless of their skills or the subject they studied. The UK Government is hoping that the two-year allowance will increase their chance of finding long-term employment in the UK.” During these two years, graduates can then find employment that will fulfil the criteria for immigration routes leading to permanent residence, and switch to these routes. It will also be possible for these graduated to switch to other routes during this time that leads to permanent residence in the UK.
