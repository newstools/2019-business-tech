Pick n Pay has been preparing for Black Friday 2019 for several months, with the retailer expecting customers to use the shopping holiday for most of their year-end purchases. John Bradshaw, retail executive of marketing at Pick n Pay, says that pantry items were most popular last Black Friday, closely followed by televisions and beer “Many customers used Black Friday deals as an opportunity to refill their pantries, especially ahead of the Christmas period,” he said. “Popular items included long-life milk, sugar, coffee, rice washing power and toilet paper.” Deals Bradshaw said that Pick n Pay customers typically have two priorities on Black Friday: they want to stock up on basic food items, but they also want to spoil themselves. “We believe we’ve secured great deals this year to deliver just that for Black Friday. Our supermarkets will have deals on everyday items while our Hypermarkets will also offer great deals on a range of appliances and electronics,” he said. “We’ve been working with our suppliers for months now to ensure all stores and online have the right stock available, at the right prices, in the right quantities.” Bradshaw said that Pick n Pay will also increase their staffing complement in stores to manage deliveries, assist customers on the floor, and ensure that every till point is open to minimise queue times. The PnP online shop team and technology systems have also been bolstered to manage Black Friday online orders as many customers turn to online shopping for convenience, he said. He added that the retailer will also hold an online sale in the lead up until the 29th of November. “We are excited to run our Black November weekly online deals once again. “Launching on Monday (4 November), online customers in Cape Town and Johannesburg can expect discounts of up to 50% across various categories on Pick n Pay’s online shop,” it said.
