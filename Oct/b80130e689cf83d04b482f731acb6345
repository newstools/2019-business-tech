Vehicle tracking company Tracker has released its latest crime index, highlighting vehicle theft and hijacking trends in South Africa right now. The data is based on statistics from Tracker’s 1.1 million installed vehicle base for the period July to September 2019. The data shows that the majority (58%) of all activations – where Tracker initiated recovery action – are in Gauteng. This is followed by Kwa-Zulu Natal, Western Cape, North West, Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo and Northern Cape, respectively. Most activations for hijackings take place on Saturday followed by Thursday, while vehicles are activated for theft equally on Friday and Saturday. These hijackings take place between 10h00 and 14h00 as well as 20h00 and midnight, on any day of the week, while theft activations occur mainly between 05h00 and 08h00. The top hijacking hotspot routes include: The N3 from Heidelberg to Vosloorus;
The N12 from Phola to Daveyton;
South Rand Road (N17);
The R50/ Delmas Road;
The N14, the R512;
The Moroka Bypass on the N12;
The Molefe Makinta Highway (M21);
The Sybrand van Niekerk Freeway (R59) and the R21.  Trends Tracker said hostage-taking during hijackings remains a concern. The group said that an average of 29% of its activations result in a hostage being taken, with 1% suffering a physical injury or fatality. “While the 2018/2019 SAPS crime statistics noted a national decrease of 1.8% in car and truck hijackings and a national decrease of 4.6% in vehicle theft, vehicle-related crime remains high with a total 17,208 car and truck hijackings and 48,324 vehicles reported stolen,” said Ron Knott-Craig, executive operational services at Tracker South Africa. “The SAPS figures combined with Tracker’s statistics, which note a consistency in vehicle crime trends, indicate that South Africans should be wary and remain vigilant at all times. South Africans should be particularly vigilant at this time of year, as we have in the past noted a peak in vehicle-related crimes during October and November.” Read: Government is proposing changes to South Africa’s new demerit system – and it’s a ‘nightmare’
