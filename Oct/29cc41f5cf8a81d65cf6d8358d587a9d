Property developer Atterbury has launched its first foray into shared workspaces – Attspace. The first Attspace office is located at the La Gratitude Manor House on Stellenbosch’s historic Dorp Street, a national monument built in 1798 and the second-oldest building in South Africa’s second-oldest town. “Attspace is Atterbury’s first venture into the exciting world of co-working,” said Jackie Raubenheimer, leasing manager of Attspace “We are experimenting with the concept at our Stellenbosch property and, based on its success, intend to expand our unique vision for shared offices into other areas of South Africa.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-348134 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="840" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-1-1200x1200.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-1-50x50.jpg 50w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-348136 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-2-1200x801.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-2.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-348138 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-3-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-3-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-3-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Atta-3.jpg 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Atterbury said that the co-working space has all the amenities required for everyday business, including: High-speed uncapped fibre Internet
