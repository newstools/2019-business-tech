Motorists can expect fuel prices to drop slightly across the board in November as a result of a decline in the oil price in recent weeks. This is according to the Automobile Association (AA), which was commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund (CEF). “The rand has pulled back from its high point at the start of October. This ongoing decline in the average exchange rate has meant that most of its losses have been clawed back, and it will have only a modest impact on the fuel price,” the AA said. The association noted that international oil prices also declined slightly as October wore on. “As a result, we are anticipating November drops of between eight and 18 cents for petrol, 14 cents for diesel, and 21 cents for illuminating paraffin,” the AA said. The AA said that oil ticked up slightly from its late-October plateau, adding that this could be the start of a strengthening trend into November. “Whatever happens to the oil price and rand from this point affects the price motorists will be paying at the pumps at Christmas. It remains to be seen whether this month’s reductions will continue for the rest of the year,” the AA said.
