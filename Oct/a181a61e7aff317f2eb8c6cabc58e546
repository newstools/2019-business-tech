The board of directors at listed technology holding group, 4Sight have announced the resignation of its chairman of the audit and risk committee, Geoffrey Carter with immediate effect. “Mr Carter has resigned due to the untenable situation at a major subsidiary level, which has led to such subsidiary executives sending a variety of emails containing, inter alia, false accusations and also looking to reconstitute the board as separately announced,” 4Sight said in a statement. 4Sight Holdings Subsidiaries operate within three distinct business clusters, including platform systems; mining, manufacturing, energy & chemicals; and telecommunications & media. Carter said his position “is being compromised to a point of no return, where serious issues of financial irregularities have occurred”. 4Sight took the unusual step of publishing some of Carter’s comments, as rationale for his resignation, penned as part of an email exchange. Carter communicated as follows: 4Sight said it has made the JSE aware of the current situation with certain subsidiaries and the challenges facing the board. “The resignation of Mr Carter is deeply regretted and he has served the board in an ethical, constructive and professional manner from before the original listing of the company,” it said. Market commentator, Wayne McCurrie, of First National Bank- Wealth and Investments, took to social media to express his surprise by the announcement.  Read: 4Sight appoints new group CEO
