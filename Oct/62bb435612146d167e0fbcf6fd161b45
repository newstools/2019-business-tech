The Wildlife & Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA) has announced that 64 Blue Flags will be flown at 45 beaches, nine marinas and by 10 sustainable tourism boats around South Africa over the forthcoming 2018/19 Blue Flag season. Now in its 32nd year, the Blue Flag programme is focused on the conservation of marine and coastal habitats, and is designed to raise environmental education and awareness, and increase sound environmental practices among tourists, local populations and beach management. To achieve Blue Flag status, as many as 33 different criteria spanning four aspects of coastal management must be met and maintained: water quality, environmental education and information, environmental management, and safety and services. Each Blue Flag site is compelled to conduct several environmental education activities during the year, and practise effective and efficient conservation management. In 2018/19, the Western Cape achieved the highest number of Blue Flag sites, with 33 beaches, 10 boats and seven of the nine Blue Flag marinas. The Eastern Cape was awarded two Blue Flag Marina sites, as well as six beaches, while Kwa-Zulu Natal was awarded six Blue Flag beaches. The Blue Flag season officially opens on 1 November 2019.
