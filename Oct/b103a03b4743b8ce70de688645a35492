Despite previous intention to avoid load shedding on the weekend, Eskom announced that stage 1 rolling blackouts would have to be implemented on Saturday between 09h00 and 23h00. Eskom said that recovery processes were underway, but it was still sitting with several generating units offline. “We hope to have recovered by Sunday so that South Africans can enjoy watching the Springboks playing in the Rugby World Cup,” it said. The power utility was on track to avoid load shedding over the weekend, but it was hit by a major setback on Friday morning when three additional units went offline due to faults. It lost capacity at Medupi 3, 4 and 5 due to coal and ash handling issues. This is in addition to the conveyer belt that failed on Saturday (12 October) at the power station. Eskom apologised to its customers and South Africans for the short notification. “We will keep South Africans informed about the status and our recovery efforts throughout this period,” it said.
