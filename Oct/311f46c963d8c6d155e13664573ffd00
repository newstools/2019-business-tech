State power utility Eskom will institute stage 2 load shedding on Wednesday (16 October) due to a shortage of capacity. In a tweet, the embattled firm said that the outage will be implemented from 09h00 to 23h00, with a list of the affected are set to be published shortly. In September, Eskom said that it did not expect load shedding in September or October. In response to a DA statement which indicated that power outages might be on the cards in the coming months, the power utility said that it has not communicated this information to any of its stakeholders and that its system was still running according to plan. “Eskom communicated its summer plan on the 4th September 2019 at a media briefing held at Megawatt Park, where we indicated that while no load shedding is expected over summer the risk, however, remains as the system is still tight and vulnerable, as we ramp up plant maintenance,” it said. “Following a statement by the Democratic Alliance’s regarding possible load shedding, Eskom’s acting group chief executive Jabu Mabuza is open to discuss details with Ms Mazzone. “Eskom continues to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand.”   Read: 5 big decisions that need to be taken on Eskom
