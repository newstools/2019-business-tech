The Presidency has published its annual report for the 2018/19 financial year, revealing that it had paid out R6.74 million in salaries for both president Cyril Ramaphosa and deputy president David Mabuza. The payouts were in line with the budgeted salary expenditure as recorded in the budget speech for the 2018/19 financial year, where the president was allocated a salary of R3.6 million, and the deputy president around R3.1 million. Despite the finance minister announcing in his February 2019 budget speech that a pay freeze would be instituted among the executive as part of a cost-cutting measure, the budgeted salaries for Ramaphosa and Mabuza in the 2019/20 financial years, and beyond, are higher. In the budget documents, the salary allocation for Ramaphosa in the current financial year is 8.3% higher at R3.9 million (R3.3 million for the deputy president). This is budgeted to increase to R4.2 million for the 2020/21 and R4.5 million 2021/22 financial years (R3.6 million in 2020/21 and R3.8 million in 2021/2022 for the deputy president). The president has previously donated half of his salary to the Nelson Mandela Foundation.
