Rawson Developers has launched a new luxury apartment development in Cape Town’s Observatory suburb, targeted at students, with prices starting at R1.2 million for 34 square metres. The Westwood caters to a lock-up and go lifestyle, offering 64 designer apartments with state-of-the- art security, a scenic rooftop entertainment deck with heated pool and outdoor gym. All apartments feature floor to ceiling glass doors and windows and views from all balconies in every unit. Rawson said that being located in Observatory makes it an appealing option for students and professionals alike, due to its proximity to the University of Cape Town and the Cape Town central business district. Micro apartments start at R1.2 million, moving up to 71–97 square metres for a two bed, two bath apartment, which range between R2.55 million and R3.95 million.  The micro apartments use smart design to make the best use of the limited space, and are best suited for students, while the larger apartments cater for young professionals or young couples looking for a starter home, Rawson said.
