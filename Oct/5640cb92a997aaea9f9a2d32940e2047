Global financial group Credit Suisse has published its latest Global Wealth Report for 2019, showing that South Africans have become poorer over the last decade. According to Credit Suisse, household wealth in South Africa grew strongly prior to the global financial crisis, rising from US$9,560 in the year 2000 to US$25,280 in 2007 on a per-adult basis. The country exceeded its 2007 wealth level for a single year in 2010 but mean wealth has declined by US$5,000 since then, leaving it with a wealth per adult of US$21,380 in mid-2019. “This is largely due to currency depreciation, as the rand has lost half its value since 2010,” the group said. “In local currency units, wealth per adult rose 55.9% from 2010 to 2019, although after correcting for inflation there was a fall of 0.1%, i.e. virtually no change.” The group recorded a decline in total wealth held by the adult population in 2019 while also seeing declines in the number of wealthy individuals in the country. 65% of adults have wealth below US$10,000, which is higher than the 58% rate for the world as a whole. However, the country also has fewer individuals with wealth above US$100,000 – 3.2% versus 10.6%. “Nevertheless, we estimate that 51,000 South Africans are members of the top 1% of global wealth holders and that 46,000 are USD millionaires. “The overall level of wealth inequality is high. South Africa has a wealth Gini coefficient of 81% and the share of the top 1% in total household wealth is 35%,” the group said. 51,000 South Africans in the global 1% is a decline of 10,000 people from 61,000 recorded in 2018. Using Credit Suisse’s data, we can determine that the average one-percenter is worth around $750,000 (R11 million). South Africa has an adult population of 36 million people, carrying a total wealth of $770 billion (±R11.3 trillion). The top 1% (360,000 people) account for 35% of this wealth ($265.9 billion), averaging at $748,661 per person (R10.99 million).
