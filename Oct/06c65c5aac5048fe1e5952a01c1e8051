Eat Out has published its list of 30 nominees for its annual restaurant awards. The nominees were picked by a panel of critics made up of a diverse range of individuals including seasoned journalists, bloggers, writers, trained chefs, caterers, food personalities, lecturers and former restaurateurs. These industry experts rate thousands of candidates – including the most viewed restaurants on the site, those that received reader reviews, and those recommended by critics. The highest-scoring restaurants are then reviewed and the best are selected to form the Eat Out 500. The critics always dine unannounced and pay for their meals in full to ensure fair, unbiased reviewing. The official list of the top 10 restaurants in the country will be announced in November. As in previous years, the list is dominated by restaurants from Cape Town and the Western Cape.  However, there are a number of notable selections from Gauteng and KZN.
