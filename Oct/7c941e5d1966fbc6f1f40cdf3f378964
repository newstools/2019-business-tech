King Goodwill Zwelithini plans to launch a new mobile network in South Africa on 1 November – Bayede Mobile. Bayede is a Zulu salutation that translates to ‘hail the king’, and is already used in brands that have received the King Zwelithini’s seal of approval – such as Bayede! Wines. The company was born from a strategic partnership forged between King Zwelithini, the founders of JR Capital, and a ‘well-established Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) with both local and international expertise’. “As a new and affordable mobile network for the people of South Africa, it is the vision of Bayede Mobile to enable communities to connect easily at reasonable rates, empowering a generation of South Africans navigating the technological era, where connecting to friends, family and information can be accessed by all,” the group said. “Bayede Mobile will be strategically positioned to leverage existing infrastructure of some of South Africa’s biggest mobile networks, thereby bringing reliable connectivity, at an affordable flat rate.” Speaking to The Sowetan, director of Bayede Mobile Jane Nkadimang said that network will be hosted on Cell C and MTN. “We will soon have marketing activations in various villages and towns in KZN. We encourage communities to come together and form social groupings so that they can benefit,” she said. “And the best thing is that whatever profit that we make will be ploughed back to the community through various community development projects such as clinics and learning centres.” Read: MTN to relaunch mobile money service in South Africa
