Rand Water will institute stage 2 water supply in areas across Johannesburg from Thursday (24 October), due to high demand. Johannesburg Water said that normal expected water supply from Rand Water is 4,370Ml/d. However, the average consumption has crept up to 4,900Ml/d forcing the water utility to take action. “The current demand at 4,900Ml/d is unsustainable and will result in water supply disruptions,” it said. “Rand Water is now implementing restrictions to various areas in their network to bring down the demand and this is aimed at ensuring equitable supply and system stability. “City of Johannesburg residents are urged (to) reduce their water consumption patterns as water usage has increased at an alarming rate and this is of serious concern given the recent heatwave we have been experiencing.” Johannesburg Water said that it has begun throttling reservoirs to between 20% – 40% in line with Rand Water restrictions. The body cautioned that another heatwave is scheduled to hit this weekend and that lowered consumption was required to help protect vital infrastructure. It added that the restrictions have hit its reservoir capacity across the city. “We appeal to all to use water sparingly and to remind them that level one water restrictions are still in place. “Watering of gardens is not allowed between 06h00-18h00 in summer months (1 September-31 March) and furthermore (users_ are not allowed to wash paved areas and driveways using hosepipes”.
