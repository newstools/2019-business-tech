The City of Johannesburg says it has detected a network breach which resulted in unauthorised access to its information systems. In a statement published late on Thursday (24 October), the city said that the incident is being investigated by its cybersecurity experts. These experts have taken ‘immediate and appropriate’ actions to reinforce security measures and mitigate any potential impacts, it said. “As a result, several customer-facing systems – including the city’s website, e-services, and billing system – have been shut down as a precautionary measure.” “The investigation which is set to take 24 hours, means that customers will not be able to transact on e-services or log queries via the city’s call centres or customer service centres.” It added that all emergency calls have been diverted to its provincial call centre (112). While the City of Johannesburg did not indicate how it was attacked and what information may be compromised, a number of South African Internet Service Providers (ISPs) said they been targeted by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks over the last week. Speaking to MyBroadband, both Cybersmart and Cool Ideas said that their networks had been impacted by the attacks. Read: Growth in fintech means more cyber attacks
