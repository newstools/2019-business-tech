Property developer Atterbury says is making progress on its R1.2 billion Jewel City redevelopment project in Johannesburg’s central business district (CBD). Atterbury posted updated images of how the rejuvenation is progressing, a year in to the project. Jewel City is located in the eastern CBD of Johannesburg, on Fox Street, between the existing Maboneng and Absa precincts. The redevelopment consists of six city blocks, five of which have existing commercial buildings. Progress:  Atterbury development manager, Derrick Pautz, said the plan is to open up the precinct which has been closed to the public for several years, and ‘pedestrianise’ Fox Street, creating a safe, green, space for people to enjoy.

Upon completion, the new district will include: 20,000 square metres of commercial office space
