SweepSouth, the online platform providing on-demand and regular home cleaning services, says it aims grow its market share in South Africa and launch additional services following the closure of a funding round that has seen the company raise more than R50 million in new investment. The final deal signed in the funding round was with the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which has invested $1 million (R14.5 million) into the company. This investment follows the June announcement of a R30 million investment by Naspers Foundry, a start-up fund aimed at boosting the South African technology sector. In addition to Naspers Foundry and the Dell Foundation, existing investors Smollan, Vumela, CRE VC (previously Africa Angels Network), and musician and venture capitalist Black Coffee have also reinvested into SweepSouth bringing the total investment raised by SweepSouth in this round to more than R50 million. Since its launch in 2014, SweepSouth said it has recorded ‘exceptional growth’. Since the closure of the previous funding round in 2017, it has expanded its operations and now operates in seven South African cities, it said. “The company has also grown 26% since the announcement in June 2019 of the investment by Naspers Foundry.” In a partnership with insurtech start-up Simply, it has also been able to provide accidental death and disability cover at no cost to domestic cleaners who find work through SweepSouth. The company also partnered with Caveat Legal for their launch of The Warrior Project to domestic workers, providing legal help and advice. Since its last funding round, SweepSouth said its customer base, bookings and revenue has tripled. “The businesses growth has afforded SweepSouth the opportunity to create more almost 15 000 employment opportunities for previously unemployed and underemployed domestic workers.” According to Aisha Pandor, chief executive and co-founder of SweepSouth, this worker-centric approach will also be a primary consideration as it expands into new markets and offering services beyond domestic services. Pandor is the daughter of International Relations and Cooperation minister, Naledi Pandor. “The funding received during this round will be instrumental in achieving SweepSouth’s strategic goals going forward. “In addition to expanding the markets we operate in, in South Africa and elsewhere on the continent, we are also looking forward to a formal announcement regarding our new platform, SweepSouth Connect, which offers services like handymen, plumbers, electricians, locksmiths, carpet cleaners, and nannies, as well as the growth of our online SweepSouth Shop which sells a range of home products,” Pandor said.
