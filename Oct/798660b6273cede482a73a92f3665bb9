Eskom announcing a second day of rolling blackouts across the country on Wednesday (10 October), as it battles with severe capacity constraints. A breakdown of equipment feeding coal to the Medupi power stations this past weekend, coupled with an increase in generating units being taken down for unscheduled maintenance, has forced Eskom to implement load shedding for the first time in months. According to the group’s chief operating officer, Jan Oberholzer, realistically South Africans should expect load shedding to remain a factor in their lives for at least the next week. “Should the system improve, obviously we will relieve load-shedding wherever we can,” he said. While some municipalities like the City of Cape Town and the City of Johannesburg look for ways to mitigate outages, for most South Africans, load shedding schedules are in full effect until further notice. For those living in South Africa’s major metros, here is where you can check to see when you will be hit: City of Johannesburg
City of Ekurhuleni 
City of Tshwane

Nelson Mandela Bay

Buffalo City For access to other load shedding schedules, Eskom has made them available on loadshedding.eskom.co.za. Smartphone users can also download the app EskomSePush to receive push notifications when load shedding is implemented, as well as the times the area you are in will be off.
