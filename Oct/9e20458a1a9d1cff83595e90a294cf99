The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) has released a new consultation paper showing that there are 463,833 security officers employed across South Africa – excluding those employed in-house by companies. However, this figure does not account for the large number of individuals who are not currently employed, with Psira estimating that there are as many as 2.36 million security officers are registered in the country. By comparison, the recently published South African Police Service (SAPS) annual report shows that the SAPS has a total of 192,277 employees – including 150,855 SAPS Act members and 41,422 Public Service Act employees. This gives South Africa a ratio of 1 police officer to 383 people in the country, which is far removed from the international standard of 1 to 220. This means that there are close to two and a half security officers to every police officer in South Africa. Police officer salaries The SAPS annual report shows that employees work across a range of sectors including ‘administration’, ‘visible policing’ and ‘crime intelligence’, with salaries averaging at R151,000 for the lowest skills level (1-2). This rises to an average salary of R1,284,000 for senior management and executive employees (levels 13-16). The average salary across all levels is R371,000. The below tables show the personnel costs by programme and costs by salary bands: <img class="size-full wp-image-345568 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-1.png" alt="" width="1069" height="410" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-1.png 1069w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-1-300x115.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-1-768x295.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-1-1024x393.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-345570 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-2.png" alt="" width="1073" height="339" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-2.png 1073w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-2-300x95.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-2-768x243.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Table-2-1024x324.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Security officer salaries The latest Psira salary data (January 2019) shows that security guards, on average, earn substantially less than police officers. The current minimum wage ranges from R4,160 – R5,558 a month depending on their role and the geographical area they work in.  This works out to an annual salary of between R50,000 – R66,700. However, it should be noted that this is a minimum baseline salary and that guards may earn substantially more depending on which security company they work for. Private security officers in South Africa are paid according to the roles and responsibilities they have. Guards are therefore graded between A and E based on the type of duty they perform. While the department lists Area 1 and Area 2 regions together, previous releases list the following as Area 2: Bloemfontein, East London, Kimberley, Klerksdorp, Pietermaritzburg, Somerset West, Stellenbosch and Strand. The rate of pay differs across South Africa in the following brackets. Read: The most common reasons why loans are rejected in South Africa
