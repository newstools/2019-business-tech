Parliament’s portfolio committee on justice and correctional services have adopted a new bill which will require political parties to record their funding. The Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) Amendment Bill makes it an obligation for the head of a political party – including independent candidates – to create and keep records of any donation exceeding the prescribed threshold in any given financial year. This threshold is currently set to include any donations exceeding R100,000. Political parties are also required to: Record the identity of the persons or entities who made such donations;
Make the records available every quarter;
Keep the records for at least five years after the records concerned have been created. Committee chairperson, Bulelani Magwanishe, said the committee ensured that the bill provides for any registered political party as defined in the Electoral Act, irrespective of whether it has representation in the national, provincial or local government, to keep records. He added that the bill is currently scheduled to be debated in the National Assembly in the coming week. Read: Cabinet ministers to be hit with pay freeze and reduced benefits
