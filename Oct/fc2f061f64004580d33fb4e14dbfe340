Based on current AutoTrader sales statistics for 2019, the Ford Ranger takes top spot for the most popular (sold) second-hand 4×2 double cab diesel bakkies in South Africa under R450,000. The average selling price for all Rangers in this category is R295 646.90, with an average mileage of the vehicles sold at 83,722 km, AutoTrader said. The Toyota Hilux is the second most sold double cab 4×2 bakkie in the under R450,000 price category. “Buyers are happy to pay a premium for the Japanese bakkie, with the average selling price being R325,624,70 – a premium of almost R30,000 over the Ford,” it said. “Buyers are also quite comfortable with a Hilux that has clocked more distance; the average mileage pertaining to all Hilux sales is 113,099 km,” it added. The third most sold double cab 4×2 bakkie in the under R450,000 price category is the Isuzu KB, which – in line with naming conventions around the world – was recently renamed the Isuzu D-Max. The average price paid drops right down to R278 874,40 while the average mileage – at 98 651 km – is more middle of the road, AutoTrader said. The older Isuzu KB is listed separately to the D-Max on AutoTrader, and – as can be seen by the sales analysis – it is still very much in demand. The D-Max is however gaining in popularity too; it is currently seventh on the list of most sold model ranges – after the Nissan NP300 Hardbody in fourth spot, the Volkswagen Amarok in fifth and the Mazda BT-50 in sixth. What about individual variants of these brands? The Ford Ranger still rules the roost, said AutoTrader. “In fact, the Ranger gallops in first, second and third when it comes to individual variants: the Ranger 2.2 Double Cab Hi-Rider XL is the top-selling double cab 4×2, followed by the 2.2 TDCi Double Cab Hi-Rider XL in second place and the 3.2 Double Cab Hi-Rider XLT Auto in third.” The average selling prices for these Ford Ranger’s varies greatly: from R256,673,85 for the 2.2 TDCi Double Cab Hi-Rider XL to R325,624,27 for the 3.2 Double Cab Hi-Rider XLT Auto. The average mileage hardly differs: it ranges from 83,089 km for the 2.2 TDCi Double Cab Hi-Rider XL to 87,469 km for the 3.2 Double Cab Hi-Rider XLT Auto. Two Isuzu models – the KB 250D-Teq Double Cab Hi-Rider and KB 300D-Teq Double Cab LX – clock in fourth and fifth when it comes to individual variants. Perhaps surprisingly, the Hilux only achieves sixth and seventh spot in the individual variant race – with the 2.8GD-6 Double Cab Raider Auto and 3.0D-4D Double Cab Raider respectively, AutoTrader pointed out.
