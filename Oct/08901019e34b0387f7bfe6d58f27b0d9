Comair has warned that it expects disruptions on its network on Tuesday (22 October) which may impact some of its flights. The airline said that the delay is due to a notice issued by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) which prevented some of its planes from being flown. “The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) issued a notice related to irregular findings picked up during a recent audit of one of our maintenance and technical service providers, South African Airways Technical (SAAT). “Affected aircraft may not be flown until the necessary corrective action has been carried out,” it said. Comair said it has contingency plans in place and aim to minimise any disruption to its operations and will keep customers updated. “We do apologise to our customers for any inconvenience to their travel plans and appreciate their support. We are working closely with SAAT to rectify the findings and getting our flights back on schedule as soon as possible. “Comair is committed to providing a safe, secure, reliable and quality airline service to its customers. The safety and security of our customers and personnel is our foremost priority and is never compromised.” SAA South African Airways (SAA) said it may operate an amended flight schedule Tuesday following a decision to recall some of its aircraft to undertake compliance verification in line with South African Civil Aviation Authority requirements. The decision to recall the aircraft follows an oversight inspection conducted by SACAA at SAA’s maintenance subsidiary, South African Airways Technical, the airline said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg. Some flights will operate later than usual and four domestic flights have been cancelled, but the airline will combine flights and deploy bigger aircraft to accommodate affected passengers, it said. Whilst there were only four domestic flight cancellations, SAA took steps to combine flights and deploy bigger aircraft to accommodate affected passengers. This has significantly reduced the impact of the inconvenience on the customers. The operational impact on the domestic flights is as per the table below. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-347846" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SAA.png" alt="" width="673" height="463" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SAA.png 673w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SAA-300x206.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: SAA responds to ‘fake parts’ claims and says faulty plane experienced ‘minor jolt akin to driving through a pothole’
