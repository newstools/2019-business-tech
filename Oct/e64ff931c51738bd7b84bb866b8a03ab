Spur has equipped 30 of its restaurants with Sensormatic technology to ensure children are kept within a safe zone. The technology – which is being rolled out in partnership with security company Fidelity ADT – follows a May 2019 pilot project started in May at the Spur outlet in Sunninghill. During the pilot project, Sensormatic pedestals were placed at the entrance/exit of the store and magnetic pinless tags were attached to children’s clothes as they entered the play area. “The proof of concept was so successful and well-received by patrons that the initiative has been rolled out to 29 other Spur franchises around the country,” said says Ilze Van Eck, retail lead at Fidelity ADT. “This could not have come at a better time considering the increase in incidents involving children being reported on of late,” she said. On entry into the play area, each child’s clothing is tagged by a childminder for that area. The tags attach securely without damaging the child’s clothing and staff are trained on where to attach the tag so it does not hurt the child in the play area. The tag can only be removed at the pay desk once the family leaves with the child. “If a child attempts to leave the restaurant without his or her parents an alarm activates,” says van Eck. Van Eck this technology will go a long way to ensure that restaurants and other venues, where children’s activities are on offer, remain secure. “The technology has been used for years in retail stores so it made perfect sense to introduce it into the restaurant industry. We believe that other restaurant chains will follow suit as there is increased demand for security, especially when it comes to children,” she said.
