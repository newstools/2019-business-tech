Rand Water says it is working hard to manage the water demand requirements of its customers in Gauteng, North West, Free State and Mpumalanga – but has warned that it is facing significant stress. In a statement, the water provider said that the current combination of extremely high temperatures and virtually no rainfall within its area of supply has resulted in high water consumption levels, which is placing a significant amount of stress on its system. “We are continuously monitoring all our reservoir levels and those of our customers. This information is critical in understanding the water demand situation of the system in order to facilitate any timeous and fit for purpose interventions,” it said. “We note the measures adopted by our municipal customers to manage the situation; including the monitoring of adherence to water restrictions where applicable and the prioritisation of the repair of municipal water leaks.” The group said that consumers must also play their part by using water sparingly and protecting it as a vital commodity. “Water is too precious to waste and is a natural resource that can no longer be taken for granted,” it said.
