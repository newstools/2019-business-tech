Traci Maynard is an Executive at Axiz – a value added enterprise technology distributor – and plays a key role in the success of the company. Maynard is responsible for several tech vendors including Microsoft, for which she manages the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Volume Licensing, and cloud businesses across South Africa and Africa. According to Maynard her company believes that it’s vital for women to be part of the senior leadership team, as this is key to balancing the gender mix across the business. “As one of two women on the Axiz executive committee, I’m pleased to be able to work in partnership with Microsoft. Part of their current licensing strategy is Microsoft’s ‘Move to Modern’ approach, which is designed to enable innovative new cloud and business scenarios that scale. This incorporates CSP as a key program to enable partners to move their end-customers to the cloud with ease,” added Maynard. As they drive the cloud message across the partner ecosystem, Axiz would like to remind their partners about two key incentives that they are running; the first one is the Microsoft 365 net new customer add campaign to all partners across SA and Africa, valid from 16 July to 31 December 2019. “This incentive rewards all AxizCloud registered partners with a percentage of their earnings for simply selling Microsoft CSP (Cloud Solution Provider) seats and creating new tenants with specific focus on Microsoft’s Azure platform. Ultimately, this talks to the number of new end customer additions that a partner has engaged, interacted, and transacted with using their cloud licensing model,” said Maynard. The second is their Microsoft Inspire 2020 incentive, which includes four fully paid, all access passes to join Axiz Executives at this annual global vendor conference.  Three tickets are for South African partners, and one ticket for outside of South Africa (on African continent). “Our partners only need to do three things and the Microsoft business unit is committed to help; one is to upsell to Microsoft 365, the second is to deploy TEAMS, the third is to sell SQL Server and Windows Server via CSP,” concluded Maynard.
