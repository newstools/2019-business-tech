With 10 days of no load shedding, the probability of load shedding for the rest of this week is low, Eskom said on Wednesday. In a statement on Wednesday, the power utility said generating plant performance has improved. However, Eskom cautioned that the system continues to remain vulnerable, adding that any unexpected shift such as an increase in unplanned breakdowns could result in load shedding at short notice. “Eskom wishes to thank customers for their understanding and for using electricity sparingly. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand,” it said. Eskom has implemented stage two rational load shedding from 9am until 11pm. The power utility began implementing load shedding on and off on 16 October following delays in the return to service of units that are on planned maintenance and limited diesel supply. Two days into implementing load shedding at the time, Eskom Acting Group Chief Executive Officer Jabu Mabuza said a broken conveyor belt at Medupi used to transport coal to the plant, a failure on six boiler tubes, coupled with planned maintenance, were among some of the challenges.
