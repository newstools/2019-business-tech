Capitec says that it is working on resolving issues with its internet banking platform. Clients who are trying to log onto their internet banking or make transactions through the banking app are being met with errors, with the bank saying that services are currently offline. Users reported being unable to log in to online banking or the app, being met with connection errors, or a page from the bank saying that its services are offline. In most cases the screens are filled with blank responses with no information on the downtime. “We are experiencing intermittent issues. Our IT team is working on fixing the issues as soon as possible. Apologies for the inconvenience,” the bank said on its social media channels. The downtime has been affecting clients since at least 10h30 on Friday. At the time of writing services had not yet been restored, and the online banking profiles could not be loaded.
