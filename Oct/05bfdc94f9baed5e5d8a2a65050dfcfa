Parliament’s land expropriation committee has published a draft programme on its upcoming plans. The programme focuses on a new draft bill which will amend section 25 of the Constitution to explicitly allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. The draft programme shows that the committee hopes to present the draft bill on 27 November 2019 and have several sessions for deliberations by members of parliament. Following this, the bill is likely to be published in the government gazette on 10 December 2019, after which a public awareness drive will start. The official call for public comments is expected to come to an end on 27 January 2020. “Public participation is a constitutional imperative. We will ensure that there is sufficient public participation,” said committee chairperson Dr Mathole Motshekga. “We will put the interests of South Africans first and we want to ensure that all South Africans participate. “The committee wants to give everyone an opportunity to give input, even those who have a different view. “We will make sure that the interests of all South Africans are put first as it is not just the interest of a section of the public.” Motshekga cautioned that the programme is still in a draft phase and that some dates and procedures may still change.
