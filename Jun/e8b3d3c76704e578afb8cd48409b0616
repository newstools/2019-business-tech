The South African government has published its revised guide for members of the executive, effectively replacing the controversial ministerial handbook introduced in 2007. In a circular sent to members of government, minister of public service and administration Senzo Mchunu said that the new rules will be effective from 8 June 2019. “Members of the executive and the staff supporting such members are urged to acquaint themselves with the provisions thereof and ensure that fiscal prudence is taken into account when applying the provisions thereof,” he said. The new guide covers everything from relocation expenses to cars, with most of the new perks appearing to be largely the same or slightly reigned in from the previous ministerial handbook. This guide also describes the new powers given to finance minister Tito Mboweni to directly curb spending on transport and other luxuries. However, ministers can also expect some increased benefits such as more staff members and an increased limit on home security. Below are some of the biggest and most notable perks and changes.
