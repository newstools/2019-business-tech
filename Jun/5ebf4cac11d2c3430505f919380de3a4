South Africa’s big banks have all published their full annual reports for the 2018 financial year, detailing how much their chief executive officers are remunerated. South Africa’s retail banking chiefs are some of the best paid executives in the country, as they continue to post impressive profits for their companies while working in a difficult environment. FNB boss Jacques Celliers was the lowest paid CEO, taking home just over R29 million for the 2018 financial year. However this data is for the year ended June 2018, so is not quite as up-to-date as the other groups. By comparison, Capitec CEO Gerrie Fourie was the highest paid boss taking home R56.6 million in 2018. Stats SA’s latest Quarterly Employment Survey, showed that the average employee in South Africa earns R20,190 a month, or R242,280 a year. A 2018 report by remuneration consultancy 21st Century found that CEOs at large cap companies earn an average basic salary of R5.35 million, with short-term and long-term incentives taken into account, this would bring the average closer to R13 million. On a guaranteed package level, the average large-cap CEO earns around 20 times more than the average employee (R274,525). South Africa’s biggest banking groups buck this trend by some margin, with the average CEO being paid a basic salary of R9.3 million – and when bonuses and incentives are factored in this jumps to an average of R44.6 million. Previous research by BusinessTech found that the average banking CEO gets paid 102 times more than the average employee in the sector. Here’s how the country’s retail banking CEOs got paid in the 2018 financial year (2018 for Capitec), including how much they made over 365 days.
