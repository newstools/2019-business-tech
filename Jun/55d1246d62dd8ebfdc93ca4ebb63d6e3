American Fujikura Ltd. (AFL), a subsidiary of Fujikura Ltd. Japan, was formed on November 28, 1984. Fujikura Ltd. has been in business over 130 years and is one of the oldest manufacturers of cables and wires in Japan. Fujikura’s long history started at almost the same time as the origin of the telegraph and electricity. Throughout Fujikura’s history, telecommunications have been a core business making significant contributions to Fujikura’s growth. AFL specialise in many fields including automotive wire harnesses, electronic parts, fibre cable, laser technologies, education, field-connectors, test and certification equipment, etc. They are known for their specialised OPGW division which was bought over from Draka in 2009. IC Logistix (ICL), an importer and distributor of specialised technology and equipment, was founded in May 2011 when an opportunity opened to attain the distribution rights for Fujikura’s popular range of splicer equipment for the fibre-optic telecommunications market in Southern Africa. In 2019 ICL acquired the full distributor rights for AFL – Test and Certification Department for Southern Africa. “The product range fits in perfectly with our Fujikura splice machines”, says Zach Yacumakis the Managing director of ICL. “The combination of Fujikura and AFL allows us to offer a complete turnkey solution.” ICL offer solutions for contractors in the Telecommunications industry including splicing, testing, certification, floating and specialised tools. They also offer local aftersales service at their certified state-of-the-art lab in Ferndale. Fujikura and AFL products are calibrated and repaired by their factory trained technicians.
