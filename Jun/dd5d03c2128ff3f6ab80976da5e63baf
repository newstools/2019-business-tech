The US Mission in South Africa has encouraged all residents considering travel to the United States to apply for their visa as early as possible, or risk facing extended wait times. “All visa applications at US Consulates in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban are processed as efficiently as possible, and the US Mission aims to keep the wait time for appointments at a minimum,” it said. “However, heavy demand for US visas has currently led to a longer than usual wait time in South Africa. “We encourage all potential travellers to apply for their visas at least three months before the planned travel date.” The embassy said that while it does make every effort to accommodate emergency travel and humanitarian situations – not every request for an expedited appointment can be accommodated. “For those already with valid visas, a renewal application can be submitted at any time, and we encourage these travellers not to wait until their current visa has expired to apply for a new one. “If a visa is still valid or has expired within the last 12 months, the traveller may be eligible to renew by mail without an interview.” If you plan to apply for a nonimmigrant visa to go to the United States as a temporary visitor, you can review the current wait times here.
