BusinessTech recently surveyed readers on how much they tip car guards. The survey had 4,911 respondents with just under half (43%) indicating that they tip around R5. Just over a quarter (26%) indicated that they tip R2, while 10% of readers indicated that they tip R10 or more. A large number of readers (22%) said that they do not tip at all. BusinessTech’s poll results are mostly on par with findings made by industry bodies, with a 2018 report published by Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA) finding that 89% of South Africans tip car guards, whereas only 11% indicated that they did not tip. According to the report, the most commonly noted reasons for tipping include: To gain good quality service in future;
To reward good/ quality service;
To gain social approval or to avoid social disapproval;
To conform to internalised tipping norms. <img class="size-full wp-image-319390 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Car-guard.png" alt="" width="298" height="463" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Car-guard.png 298w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Car-guard-193x300.png 193w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 85vw, 298px" /> PSIRA’s data shows that approximately 45% of respondents tip between R4 to R7, and 25% tip between R8 to R11. Approximately 18% of respondents would pay car guards between R1 to R3. In line with BusinessTech’s survey, only 3% of the respondents in Gauteng and Eastern Cape would pay R20.00 or more. <img class="size-full wp-image-319392 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Car-guard-2.png" alt="" width="761" height="708" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Car-guard-2.png 761w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Car-guard-2-300x279.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Harassment and perceived threat PSIRA also asked respondents whether they had ever been harassed by a car guard. From a national perspective, most of the respondents (77%) indicated that they had not been subjected to harassment, whereas 23% indicated that they had been harassed by car guards. In the Western Cape, almost half (48%) of respondents said that they had been harassed by a car guard. In Eastern Cape, that figure was at 39%. <img class="size-full wp-image-319396 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Risk.png" alt="" width="762" height="596" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Risk.png 762w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Risk-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> PSIRA’s survey also showed that some South Africans consider car guards to be a security risk. From a national perspective, most of the respondents (65%) indicated that they did not consider car guards to pose a risk to their car, whereas 35% did perceive some sort of risk from car guards.
