Property fund Accelerate has published its annual results as at the end March 2019, providing an update on its Fourways mega-development. The development first broke ground in 2016 and was originally scheduled for completion by mid-2018, but has seen a number of delays as development plans have changed. Accelerate said that the revised opening date for the mall is now 22 August 2019, with the development set to become one of the largest of its kind in South Africa at 178,000 m² total gross leasable area (GLA). This means that the mall will be double its original size, with 450 stores and an average anticipated footfall of up to two million visitors each month. The size of the mall excludes the Leroy Merlin flagship store which will add another 18,000 m² when it is linked to the mall at a later date. Upon opening, the mega-mall will include more than 8,000 parking bays and have 52 entrances. Accelerate, a 50% owner of the development, said that the launch of the Fourways Mall super-regional is the first step in the fund’s 15-year plan to launch the Fourways CBD–office, hospitality and other retail offerings. The mall will also include a ‘Fourways Gautrain’ station in time. Some of the most notable tenants include: Checkers
Woolworths
Game
Dion Wired
Pick ‘n Pay
Food Lover’s Market
Dis-Chem
Cotton On
