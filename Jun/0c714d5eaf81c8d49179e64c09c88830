South Africa needs to employ a further 60,000 police officers to meet United Nations standards. Speaking in a television interview on Sunday (23 June), police minister Bheki Cele said that South Africa’s police officer to citizen ratio is currently 1 to 383. This is far-removed from the international standard of 1 to 220. Cele said that police recruitment has been hampered by a ‘chicken and egg situation’, as the government can’t hire more officers due to economic restraints, while the high level of crime is impacting the economy. “Usually people talk about the bloated civil service, but what is not mentioned are the areas that still need to (hire). At the present moment, there are 193,000 police officers, which is 60,000 short of the international ratio. “We hope that we will be able to reach these figures within the next five years.” What it takes to apply Cele said that the South African Police Services (SAPS) currently has 5,000 trainees with a further 14,000 set to be added in the next two years.
