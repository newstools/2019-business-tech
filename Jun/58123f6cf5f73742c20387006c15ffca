MTN has launched its Mobile Money (MoMo) service chat bot. The chat bot went live in Ivory coast in May and will be rolled out across MTN’s MoMo footprint in the next few months. The AI mobile money “assistant” allows customers to engage with MTN’s MoMo services, including payments, on various social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and via SMS. The service will also be included over time, in MTN’s own newly released advanced instant messaging service “Ayoba”. The chat bot is an artificial intelligence guide that assists users to navigate MTN’s MoMo services and provide other useful information. “We are passionate about bringing the power of our mobile money solutions to more than 60 million customers across Africa over the next few years, said MTN Group President and CEO, Rob Shuter. “Harnessing modern technologies like artificial intelligence can improve in scale, how MTN interacts with customers, enabling them to reach us anytime and anywhere, through a variety of channels including social networks and messaging applications. “We can also harness the power of artificial intelligence to provide our customers with the right answers to their questions at the right time.” He said that the company is committed to improving financial inclusion with a range of solutions aimed at addressing the needs of various market segments.
