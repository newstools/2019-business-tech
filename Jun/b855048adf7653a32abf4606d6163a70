Property firms note that luxury home prices are generally declining in many of South Africa’s most sought-after suburbs, with sellers are more willing to negotiate. This means that you can acquire more home for your money in the current market. One home that falls into the luxury category is a ‘castle’ nestled in a private estate in Kyalami, which is on the market for R10 million. The home was built some 70 years ago from local stone, and has the facade of a castle, which belies its ultra-modern interior. The building itself occupies approximately 1,000 square metres of the 5,000 square metre stand, and features five bedrooms, five bathrooms, a kitchen, a study and three reception rooms. From the castle’s single ‘spire’, the home offers 360 degree views of the Magaliesburg and Kyalami skylines, and a patio set among the trees. Other features include: Pub room with underground wine cellar;
Feature stonework and window shutters;
Pool, and wooden sundeck;
Indigenous treed garden with borehole and irrigation;
Double garage;
2 staff suites with kitchen;
