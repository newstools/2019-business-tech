Naspers Foundry says it will invest R30 million in South African tech startup SweepSouth, an online cleaning service that connects clients with domestic cleaners. Launched at the South Africa Investment Conference in October last year, Naspers Foundry is a R1.4 billion start-up fund aimed at boosting the South African technology sector. As well as providing funding, Naspers Foundry aims to assist local technology entrepreneurs develop and grow their businesses, the company said. Co-founded in 2014 by Aisha Pandor and Alen Ribec, SweepSouth says it has recorded exceptional growth, creating jobs for more than 10,000 people. SweepSouth employees have full flexibility over their hours and availability, and benefit from pay rates ‘significantly’ higher than the national minimum wage. “We are ecstatic about the Naspers Foundry investment in SweepSouth, and believe the partnership will help us achieve our vision of expanding into other home services and growing beyond the South African market,” said Pandor, who is the daughter of minister of international relations and cooperation, Naledi Pandor. “We see ourselves as an emerging market-focused platform that aims to serve the many professionals who don’t have the time to source the services we provide, whilst also creating meaningful employment opportunities.” Read: Nasper’s PayU to buy Turkish digital payments company for R2.4 billion
