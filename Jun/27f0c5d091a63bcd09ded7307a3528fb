Recruitment website Giraffe has released a new report looking at how much junior and mid-skilled employees are paid in South Africa. The report is based on more than 131,000 Giraffe job applicants who have registered since June 2018, with 64% of the applicants being female, and 36% male. The applicants were typically between 18 to 35 years of age (87%), while a combined 21% said that they had a diploma or university degree. Respondents in this sample earn between R1,000 and R90,000 per month, with the average earning at R6,400. Top industries Giraffe’s data shows that the banking industry typically pays the best salaries in the country. “Banking (which includes insurance) and IT are the best paying sectors but employ only 8% of the junior to medium-skilled workforce,” it said. However, the data also showed that you don’t need a degree to earn an above average entry-level salary. “The construction industry, for instance, pays welders and boilermakers an average salary of R11,500,” it said.  Giraffe found that retail is the largest employer in South Africa, but pays an average salary of just R4,540. The retail and hospitality sectors pay the worst, with supermarkets having the lowest paying salaries, followed by restaurants and hotels. “A large proportion of employees in supermarkets (67%) and restaurants (50%), earn below minimum wage,” Giraffe said. “As of 1 January 2019, South Africa’s first-ever national minimum wage came into effect. This legislation stipulates a minimum national rate of R20 per hour, or R3,500 per month, depending on the number of hours worked. “Notwithstanding the introduction of minimum wage, approximately five and a half million workers across South Africa work in jobs that cannot keep them and their dependents out of poverty, these people are the ‘working poor’ and have household incomes of less than R4,125 per month,” it said.
