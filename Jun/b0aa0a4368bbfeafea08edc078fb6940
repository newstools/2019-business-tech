Ford South Africa has announced a safety recall for certain Ford Ranger models over concerns about their flexible front brake hoses. In an emailed statement, the company said that the recall applies to certain Ford Rangers built between 18 September 2014 – 28 August 2018 at the FMCSA Silverton Assembly Plant. “In affected vehicles, the brake hoses are under continual stress in their current configuration which over time leads to failure of the hose material,” it said. “The safety of our customers is our number one priority, so we are notifying customers through this recall to have their affected Front Brake Hoses replaced as a precaution.” Ford said that dealers will replace the front brake hoses at no cost to the customer. “Ford is committed to providing customers with top quality vehicles. We are equally committed to addressing potential issues and responding quickly to our customers,” it said.
