Airbnb has launched ‘Luxe’, a new luxury service which provides access to unique and spectacular properties. Airbnb said the service will allow users to stay at award-winning homes in New Zealand and South Africa, castles in France and breathtaking historic villas in Tuscany. The new tier will launch with more than 2,000 handpicked homes around the world, each one passing strict evaluation across more than 300 criteria to meet standards in both design and function. This includes elevated design standards on a variety of elements, from premium materials & finishes and rare & unique features, to spaces that accommodate groups, highly functional design, chef-grade appliances and the proper amount of bathrooms corresponding to each bedroom, Airbnb said. Each Airbnb Luxe booking will also provide 24/7 access to a dedicated, highly trained trip designer who will ensure the stay is tailored to the traveler’s unique needs. This includes ensuring booking and check-in, coordinating local bespoke experiences and activities, and arranging a wide range of services from childcare, to private chefs to in-house massage therapists – or, for the dedicated, personal training sessions in your own private gym. “Literary fans can seek inspiration and beachfront luxury at The Fleming Villa in Jamaica where Ian Fleming wrote his famous spy novels,” Airbnb said. “Others may prefer complete privacy and exclusivity by booking an entire island with its very own self-declared time zone at the incredible private atoll in French Polynesia, Nukutepipi, curated by Guy Laliberte, founder of Cirque du Soleil and Lune Rouge.” You can find some of the most notable properties on the service below: 008 Villa, Clifton, Cape Town from R23,000 a night  Nukutepipi, French Polynesia, private island from R2,073,147 a night  Casa Koko, Punta Mita, Mexico from R49,650 a night  Chateau d’Estoublon, Provence, France from R241,866 a night  Te Kahu, Wanaka, New Zealand from R37,018 a night  26 Sunset Villa, Llandudno, Cape Town from R76,000 a night Read: Airbnb’s big problem with South Africa’s proposed tourism laws
