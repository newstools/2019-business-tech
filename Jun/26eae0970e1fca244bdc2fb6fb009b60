The research – which is based on job advertisements published on Adzuna – shows that wealth is primarily concentrated in the Western Cape, Gauteng, and Limpopo provinces. The data shows that Gauteng has the highest average salary with R397,345. It is followed by the Western Cape at R382,353 and Limpopo at R382,353.
