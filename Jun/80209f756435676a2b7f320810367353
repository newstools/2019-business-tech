The City of Johannesburg has warned residents of a major water outage which may last several days. In a statement on Tuesday (18 June), the city said that its chief water supplier, Rand Water, is planning a major shutdown that will impact all of the city’s reservoirs and tower supplies for 54 hours, starting 24 June. “The shutdown is on the B11 pipeline to install a 2,500mm butterfly valve from Lethabo to Vereeniging pumping station and this will result in limited water supply for all Rand Water customers,” it said. “Please note that this does not necessarily mean that there will be no water during the 54 hours shutdown period, however, due to the extremely long hours some of the areas may experience a shortage of water or low pressure.” Johannesburg Water called on residents to use water sparingly during this time period so as to avoid a ‘complete no-water’ scenario. The outage will also affect a number of municipalities across the Gauteng Province, it said.
