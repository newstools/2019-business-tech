Apple has issued a recall for certain 15-inch MacBook Pro laptops after it determined that the battery may overheat and pose a fire safety risk. Affected units were sold primarily between September 2015 and February 2017 and product eligibility is determined by the product serial number, the company said. The recall does not affect any other 15-inch MacBook Pro units or other Mac notebooks, it said. “Because customer safety is a top priority, Apple is asking customers to stop using affected 15-inch MacBook Pro units. Customers can visit here for details on product eligibility and how to have a battery replaced, free of charge.” How to check if you are impacted Apple said that customers can check if they are affected by the recall by following the below steps: Selecting the ‘About This Mac’ option from the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen.
Upon doing so, you can confirm whether your model is ‘MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)‘.
If you have that model, you can enter your computer’s serial number here to see if it is eligible for this program. Affected users will then be able to select a number of return options with service expected to take between 1-2 weeks. According to Wired, the recall is not an isolated incident when it comes to modern versions of Apple’s premium laptops. The company’s laptops have been the subject of no fewer than five repair notices, including this latest recall, in the past year alone. Read: Huawei vs Apple vs Samsung in South Africa
