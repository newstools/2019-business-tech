The South African Police Service (SAPS) will equip their officers with body cameras to better aid in the fight against crime. Speaking to BusinessTech, a Department of Police spokesperson said that the body cameras are on the agenda of the SAPS’ top management – although no implementation date has been set as the department awaits more information on funding. “Body cameras will be used as – but not limited to – a safety measure to protect our men and woman in blue during operations,” the spokesperson said. “They will also be used for data capturing as the world is moving in the direction of the 4th Industrial Revelation and to advance policing. “I can’t give the exact date of implementation unfortunately for now, due to the allocation of funds etc.” Body lights This is not the first piece of wearable technology that will be introduced among South African police officers. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) has introduced ‘body lights’ which closely resemble the sirens attached to emergency vehicles. The lights will be worn by all officers involved in traffic management, as well as any who conduct roadblock and stop searches, ultimately making up a large proportion of the JMPD force. Spokesperson for Johannesburg Public Safety, Luyanda Longwe, said that the lights will be affixed to an officer’s shoulder and will flash red and blue. She added that the lights had officially been handed over in December and that officers would wear the lights at night for visibility purposes.
