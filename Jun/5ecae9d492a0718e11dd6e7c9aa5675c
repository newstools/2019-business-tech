New World Wealth has published its South African wealth report for 2019, looking at the trends among the country’s wealthiest people. The report found that the country is currently home to 39,200 High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) – defined as individuals who have net assets of $1 million or more. The largest portion of the country’s HNWIs acquired their wealth through the financial and professional services (including banks, law firms, accountants, fund managers and wealth managers), closely followed by the property sector. These HNWIs typically studied law, with finance and accounting degrees also popular. The University of the Witwatersrand is the most popular university among HNWIs (20%), followed closely by the University of Cape Town (19%), and Stellenbosch University (12%). Over two-thirds (68%) of these HNWIs have an undergraduate degree, while 27% have a post-graduate qualification, while just 5% have only a matric.
