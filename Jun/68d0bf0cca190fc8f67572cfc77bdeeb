The redevelopment will see this increase to 26,000sqm, including new shops, restaurants, and a new Sun Park Square designed to host major events. Other new developments will include two supermarkets, one speciality food store, two pharmacies and two or more major banks. <img class="size-full wp-image-325443 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B1.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B1.jpg 2400w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-325445 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2.jpg 2500w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B2-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-325447 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3.jpg 2400w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/B3-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “We are delighted that the Boardwalk mall development is back on track, said Anthony Leeming, CEO of Sun International. “When it is complete, the new and expanded mall will complement the Boardwalk’s other leisure offerings, and further serve the needs of surrounding communities. “We view the new mall to be an essential component of the broader Boardwalk precinct, which was identified and earmarked by the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro as an important growth node. We are confident that it will accelerate the metro’s economic growth, job creation and increased returns to the province.” Work on the project is planned to commence in early 2020.
