The data shows that The IT, business & management and finance sectors are the most sought after sectors, followed by the sales, admin, office & support and architecture & engineering sectors, among others listed. When looking at active job seekers across various sectors (indicated by the supply graph), areas of high supply correlate closely to areas of high demand, however supply outstrips demand in some areas, leading to a competitive environment for job seekers. The opposite is seen for some industries. “The sales, marketing and construction sectors have seen a notable uptake in jobs since the onset of 2019, “CareerJunction said. “Since January, job availability grew by 8% for sales professionals, 26% for marketing professionals and 13% for professionals in the construction sector. “After a significant dip in hiring activity for professionals in the medical, admin, office & support and maintenance & repair sectors during the second half of 2018, job advertising has picked up again during 2019. “Due to a considerable dip in IT jobs during April, job availability remains lower year-on-year. Although not as significant, IT job volumes continued to decrease during May.” CareerJunction said that waning employment prospects are also evident in the business & management, manufacturing & assembly, and architecture & engineering sectors where job volumes are down by 37%, 24% and 29% respectively year-on-year.
