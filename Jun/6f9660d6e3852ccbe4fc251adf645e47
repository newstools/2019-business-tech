Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC have been returned to power. But what agenda will he set for the months and years ahead? Watch The State of the Nation address wherever you are on DStv Now. The State of the Nation Address (SoNA) is typically one of the highlights of the political calendar. In February this year, President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered a memorable address, peppered with jokes, as well as serious statements about the achievements and plans of his government. He also proclaimed the election date, an election which the ANC once again won. But that doesn’t mean that 2019’s second SONA will be a rehash – Ramaphosa has election promises to deliver on and people to impress. It should be compelling viewing and it’s an essential watch for every engaged South African. But what to do if you’re not in front of your TV on Thursday night? SoNA will be showing on several DStv channels, and can also be live-streamed on DStv Now. Watch SoNA on the following channels on DStv Now Live TV: eNCA, SABC news and Channel 408, the Parliamentary Channel. DStv subscribers can sign up for DStv Now at no extra cost.
