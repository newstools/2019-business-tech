The world’s 50 best restaurants for 2019 have been announced at an awards ceremony in Singapore. The list provides an annual snapshot of the opinions and experiences of over 1,000 international restaurant industry experts. It is a globally recognised gastronomic reference point which showcases leading trends and highlights great restaurants from all corners of the Earth. The list is created from the votes of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, comprising over 1,000 international restaurant industry experts. The Academy is made up of 50% female voters and 50% male voters and it is split into 26 separate regions around the world. Each region has its own voting panel of 40 members including a chairperson to head it up. The panel in each region is made up of food writers and critics, chefs, restaurateurs and well-travelled gourmets, each of whom has 10 votes. The top restaurants are often considered to be forerunners of molecular gastronomy, and most of the restaurants on the serve haute cuisine – which is characterised by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food. Top 10 This year’s best restaurant is Mirazur in Menton, France. The top ten was dominated by European restaurants with three Spanish establishments and two restaurants in Copenhagen Denmark. South America was also well represented with two Peruvian restaurants named in the top ten. Best South African restaurants Two Cape Town restaurants were named in the top 150 in this year’s ranking.
