Ford has launched a special edition new Figo Blu hatchback in South Africa. The Figo is among the best-selling vehicles in the country, selling just under 450 units in May. Based on the five-door Figo 1.5 Trend, a limited production run of 360 units are available of the new Figo Blu with a number of styling enhancements. The Blu has a black mesh grille, while the the accented fog lamp housings has blue bezels. Black multi-spoke 15-inch alloy wheels replace the Figo Trend’s standard 14-inch versions, in conjunction with black mirror housings and decals that extend along the length of the lower section of the front and rear doors. The roof is exclusively painted in black, which provides contrast to the three available body colour choices: Moondust Silver, Oxford White and Smoke Grey. Inside the car, all four door panels incorporate blue gloss trim inserts. This is matched to a leather steering wheel, blue stitching for the gearshift gaiter, and the ‘Figo Blu’ logo embroidered on the front floor mats. All Figo models include electric windows all round, central locking, perimeter anti-theft alarm and an immobiliser. The Figo Blu is equipped with driver and passenger front airbags, and ABS brakes. As with the entire Figo range, the New Figo Blu is powered by a 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine. It relies on twin independent variable camshaft timing (TiVCT) for the four-valves-per-cylinder engine to deliver impressive low-down torque as well as top-end power. The 1.5 TiVCT engine is credited with a maximum power output of 88kW of power at 6 300 r/min, and peak torque of 150Nm at 4 250 r/min. The five-speed transmission used on the Figo Blu has an EcoMode with shift indicator, which informs the driver of the ideal point to shift up or down a gear, thereby helping to further reduce fuel consumption.
