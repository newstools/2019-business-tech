Online kitchen and homeware retailer Yuppiechef is continuing its strategy to branch out into brick and mortar, announcing two new stores in Johannesburg. The group said that it will open the stores in the Mall of Africa in Waterfall Estate, and in Sandton City on 28 June 2019. Yuppiechef CEO Andrew Smith said that the two Johannesburg stores represent a new era for the brand. “Since the launch of our first physical store two years ago, and with four Cape Town branches now thriving, we’ve always had Joburg customers asking us when their turn was coming – and now we’re opening two at once. The two new Yuppiechef stores will carry a selection of the products available on yuppiechef.com, but should an item not be available in the store, customers can order it while visiting the store and have it delivered to their preferred address. “Through the combination of our online and physical stores our customers have access to a much broader range, bigger than any single store offering,” Smith said. The stores also have a “no queue” point-of-sale system which allows that customers can pay for their basket of items at any position in the store, aided by a store assistant. Yuppiechef Sandton City opens on Friday 28th June at 09h00. Shop L337, Sandton City.
Yuppiechef Mall of Africa opens on Friday 28th June at 09h00.
