PayProp has published its rental index for 2019, showing a quarterly year-on-year (YOY) rental growth rate of 3.7%. According to the property group, the final quarter of 2018 brought the first uptick in the national rental growth rate in two years with a YOY growth rate of 4.1%. PayProp’s head of data and analytics, Johette Smuts, said that the slightly lower growth rate this quarter is still a good indicator of market recovery. “The election has been a source of uncertainty and volatility which has affected the property market and its growth,” said Smuts. “Reluctant buyers who are holding off purchasing a property ultimately need to live somewhere, and we’ll likely see an increasing demand for rental property which will push up prices and lead to further rental market recovery in 2019.” Average rent <img class="size-full wp-image-321379 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/National.png" alt="" width="665" height="407" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/National.png 665w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/National-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> PayProp’s data shows that the average national rent moved up into the R7,500 – R10,000 price brand for the first time in Q4 2018. Nevertheless, almost a third of rents processed by PayProp still fell into the R5,000 – R7,500 category. The Western Cape still weighs in as the most expensive province in which to rent, with an average rental of R9,030. Approximately 30% of rents in the Western Cape fall into the R5,000 – R7,500 category, with a further 30% priced above R10,000 including over 11% priced above R15,000 – the highest percentage in this band. Out of all the provinces, North West has the biggest percentage of renters in any one bracket – 54.6% of tenants in the region rent for between R2,500 and R5,000. It also has the country’s lowest average rent, at R5,031, and the smallest percentage of rentals over R15,000. Gauteng – R8,000 Almost 40% of Gauteng rentals are priced between R5,000 – R7,500, and yet the average rental is R8,000, the second-highest of all the provinces in Q1 2019.

KZN has the second biggest percentage of rentals priced over R15,000. <img class="size-full wp-image-321387 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/KZN.png" alt="" width="646" height="425" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/KZN.png 646w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/KZN-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Eastern Cape – R5,694 Although the average rent in the Eastern Cape is R5,694, 34% of rents in the province fall within the R2,500 – R5,000 category. Over 62% are between R2,500 – R7,500. The Eastern Cape has the highest percentage of rentals below R2,500 out of all the provinces. <img class="size-full wp-image-321381 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Eastern-Cape.png" alt="" width="647" height="428" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Eastern-Cape.png 647w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Eastern-Cape-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Free State – R6,054 At R6,054, the average rent in the Free State falls within the R5,000 – R7,500 category, and yet a third of all rentals in the province fall within in the bracket below.

Almost 20% of rentals fall within the brackets on either side, putting almost two-thirds of all Northern Cape rentals in the R2,500 – R10,000 range. Only 10% of rentals are less than R2,500 per month. <img class="size-full wp-image-321395 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Northern-Cape.png" alt="" width="650" height="432" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Northern-Cape.png 650w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Northern-Cape-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Rent vs salary in South Africa’s biggest cities
