Sasfin Bank has established a Digital Advisory Council, aimed at providing the market with expertise and insights on trends shaping the use of technology in financial services. The council will act as an independent think tank and will help Sasfin and its clients ‘decipher the fintech present and future’. The council will be headed up by Arthur Goldstuck, founder of research consultancy World Wide Worx. “My role will be, partly, to curate the wide spectrum of fintech and digitalisation knowledge and insights that the members will bring to the Digital Advisory Council, and help create scenarios that businesses and policy makers may use to navigate the future – both inside and outside Sasfin,” Goldstuck said. Sasfin CEO Michael Sassoon said further appointments to the council will be announced soon. “The Sasfin Digital Advisory Council is broader than providing only the bank with a source of insight on how digital services are evolving and lessons from across the world,” said Sassoon.
