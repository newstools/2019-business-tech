Recruitment specialist, Glassdoor, has published new research on the companies that pay the highest salaries in the UK – with South Africa’s Investec bank featuring. According to Glassdoor’s research, remuneration is the top priority among job seekers, cited as the thing people look for most in listed job ads. However, remuneration packages remain “frustratingly absent” from most recruitment ads, it said. The group’s report revealed that the UK’s highest paying companies offer staff between £61,000 and £90,000 (R1.1 million and R1.65 million) as a median total compensation package (which includes base pay plus bonus). The top-paying company – Credit Suisse, which represents the upper boundary (£90,000) – also offers the highest median basic salary at £82,000 (R1.5 million). Tech firms, such as Facebook and Google, also feature, with the tech sector and finance sector dominating the list of highest payers. Only consulting firm McKinsey & Co. deviates from this, being the only non tech or finance group in the top 25. South African banking group Investec, which entered into the UK in 1992 and listed on the London Stock Exchange a decade later, ranked 16th on the list, offering a median total package of £67,500 (R1.24 million), and a median base salary of £62,500 (R1.15 million). Based on the group’s 2018 annual report, it spent £795.4 million (R14.6 billion) on salaries and benefits for its 9,444 employees, making the average pay £84,200 (R1.55 million) – however this includes top executives, prescribed officers and the group’s CEO, Stephen Koseff, who took home a total salary of  £3.5 million (R64.2 million) in that year.
