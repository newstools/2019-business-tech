The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) will be saved from an imminent communication blackout. Speaking at the sidelines of the state of the nation address on Thursday (20 June), communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said that her department is currently finalising an application process with Treasury. “Rest assured, as soon as the Treasury finalises their processes, the SABC will continue with what it is doing,” she said.  “You are not going to get any blackout, that we promise.” The SABC is currently facing serious financial issues with the broadcaster having to choose between paying staff and municipal accounts at the end of March. Speaking to the Sunday Times, SABC board chair Bongumusa Makhathini said that he was unsure if the broadcaster would be unable to pay for salaries come the end of June. “We have not maintained any of our infrastructure and a communication blackout is imminent. We anticipated ‘Day Zero’ in March, but we have managed to stay on air until now,”he said. Read: SABC warns of a communication blackout as it runs out of money
