According to StatsSA, you are paying on average 8.6% more for a bottle of red wine than you did a year ago. White wine prices have risen by 9%. “Rooibos drinkers, in particular, have had a rough time, with prices for the tea jumping by 17,9% in the twelve months to April, “Stats SA said. “The rooibos industry is currently recovering from a four-year drought that has constrained supply, contributing to the rise in prices.” Read: A look at the Kruger Park’s new luxury ‘train lodge’ opening in December
