Connection Telecom CEO David Meintjes has underlined the importance of capitalising on the cloud, and the potential impact of emerging technologies on traditional networks in South Africa. Speaking at the 2019 MyBroadband Cloud Conference on Thursday (6 June), Meintjes said that demand for fixed-line telephones is declining rapidly. “We have seen the decline of the old telephone system,” Meintjes said. “In South Africa, less than 10% of fibre going into houses includes a fibre landline service bundled along with it.” He said that emerging technologies like blockchain and 5G will have a big impact on the evolving digital landscape globally. “5G promises to improve the experience of voice services, data, latency and more,” Meintjes said. “Blockchain is an emerging technology which will also have its application in telecoms and ICT.” He said that the potential applications of blockchain in the telecoms industry includes using a distributed ledger to control number portability, as well as enabling users to block phone calls from certain numbers. Evolving communication Meintjes said that the adoption of new communication platforms is changing the way in which consumers interact with companies. “Digital customers want to engage with companies via Facebook, mail, and chat,” he said. “76% of customers said if they receive a good customer experience they would buy more.” This makes it extremely important for companies to deliver powerful and modern channels for user interaction, and this can be facilitated most easily by the use of cloud-based platforms. Connection Telecom offers a large selection of cloud based services – including chat, voice, voice search, and translation channels – through its secure and dynamic cloud platform.
