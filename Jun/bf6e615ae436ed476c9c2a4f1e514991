Standard Bank will close more than 100 branches and retrench hundreds of staff members as part of its efforts to digitise its retail and business bank. In March, the bank announced that it plans to close more than 91 branches, with the closures impacting approximately 1,200 jobs. The bank said that the vast majority of these branches will be closed by June 2019 and that it has worked hard to minimise the impact of this re-organisation on its staff members “As part of a support programme agreed with SASBO, Standard Bank SA will implement a comprehensive exit package which significantly exceeds the requirements as set out in the Labour Relations Act,”it said. “We have also set aside funds to assist employees to acquire new skills to improve their competitiveness in the labour market, as well as entrepreneurial training and financial assistance.” As part of this closure process, Standard Bank has published the full list of branches which will be closing across the country. It has also outlined the nearest branches which will remain open.
