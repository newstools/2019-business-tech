The Department of Energy has published the petrol and diesel price changes for June 2019. According to the department, the price of petrol and diesel will increase by 9 cents per litre and 33 cents per litre for diesel. The hike is mainly due to the addition of the carbon tax of 7 cents and 8 cents per litre for petrol and diesel, respectively, as well as the additional 2 cents per litre to the fuel levy. Illuminating paraffin will increase by 8 cents per litre. The fuel prices also suffered due to a weakening rand/dollar exchange rate over the period, as well as rising international oil prices, the department said. This is how prices will change: Petrol 95: 9 cents per litre increase;
Petrol 93: 9 cents per litre increase;
Diesel (wholesale): 33 cents per litre increase;
Illuminating Paraffin: 8 cents per litre increase. Dawie Roodt, Chief Economist at the Efficient Group said that consumers should tighten their belts once again and brace themselves for difficult times ahead. “All of the main economic indicators that we track show that things are going to get a lot more difficult before there is any chance of light at the end of the tunnel. “With Eskom’s debt approaching R500-billion and the utility failing to sell enough electricity to cover its daily expenditures, it is going to be incumbent on consumers to keep it from imploding and sinking the country’s entire economy.” Another round of fuel price hikes is expected to follow in July due to the weakening exchange rate and growing volatility in the price of crude oil.
