The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has rejected a proposal that it should allow teachers to carry firearms or weapons to schools, saying it was ‘irresponsible, reckless and dangerous’, and would only escalate the violence at the country’s schools. “The department is, however, extremely concerned about the escalating violence involving learners and educators, particularly within the vicinity of schools,” it said. “The violence has left both learners and educators deceased, others injured, and perpetrators facing lengthy jail terms.” The DBE said that recent attacks have widely occurred outside school premises. “We have also observed the rise in a gang-related activity involving learners and violent incidents ending in unnecessary loss of life,” it said. “The DBE is very concerned that the violence has increasingly spilled into schools, causing untold emotional trauma and disruption to the learning and teaching environment.” Linked to police stations The DBE said that it has a long-standing protocol agreement with the South African Police Services. “Currently, 18,000 schools are linked to police stations within their vicinity,” it said. “The agreement entails the police conducting random visits to educate learners about the dangers of crime and violence, starting with bullying. “The police are also expected to conduct unannounced search and seizure operations in schools. In many such procedures, police confiscated weapons and drugs found in possession of learners. Disciplinary action is immediately taken against offending learners and the parents are called in.” Read: Major shake-up proposed for South African schools – including new rules for failing students
