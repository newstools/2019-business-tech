Online classifieds website Gumtree has published new data highlighting the entry-level jobs employers are most desperate to fill. The report shows that sales and telemarketing jobs are the most in-demand positions in South Africa – followed by construction work, accounting, financial jobs and logistics jobs. “Employers are always looking for skilled workers in these fields – sales executives being the most in-demand across provinces, while there are more Construction vacancies in Gauteng than any other province,” said Gumtree marketing manager, Estelle Nagel. However, competition for these roles remains stiff. There are ten times as many applicants looking for work as there are vacancies available. Nearly two-thirds (60%) of frequently advertised jobs are full-time, 12% are contract positions and 8.5% are part-time, but most require at least some form of qualification and/or experience. A fraction (0.35%) of advertised positions are suitable for matriculants or recent graduates. Nagel said that the job market is extremely competitive “Compile a professional CV and have a hard copy and a digital version on hand. If you need experience, volunteer where possible. Employers can make a selection from thousands of candidates – make sure that you stand out,” she said. Below Gumtree outlined the most frequently advertised vacancies: Sales and Marketing (13%)
