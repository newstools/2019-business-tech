PPS, a mutual financial services company, has published its latest Graduate Professional Index, highlighting the jobs that South African professionals find most rewarding. The index is based on a survey of 5,837 professionals across every major job category, with online self-completion interviews completed during January 2019. The results show that the majority of respondents (68%) feel confident about the future of their profession in the country over the next five years. By comparison, 71% of the respondents said that they would encourage matriculants to enter into their profession – however, some professions are more assuring than others. The majority (89%) of accounting professionals said that they would recommend their career to matriculants, while 80% of professionals said that they would recommend engineering. At the other end of the scale, less than half (45%) of respondents in dentistry would recommend their profession. <img class=" wp-image-318762 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Matriculants.png" alt="" width="932" height="467" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Matriculants.png 1192w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Matriculants-300x150.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Matriculants-768x385.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Matriculants-1024x513.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> When asked why they would recommend their profession, the majority of respondents said the ‘skills are really needed in South Africa’.
